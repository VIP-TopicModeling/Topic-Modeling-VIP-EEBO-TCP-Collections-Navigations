 was publysshed by the comyn people. wherfore it was expedyent for ther peas be kept that they sholde haue prin¦ces of noble byrth. ¶The thyrde cause proce∣deth of some synguler strength. Many tymes the comynalte were greued thrugh enmyes co¦mynge vpon them. And then they sayd y

Albyon








¶Afore that I wyll speke of Brute / it shall be shewed howe the londe of Eng∣londe was fyrst named Albyon / and by what encheson it was so named.




OF the noble londe of Sirrie / there was a ryal kynge & myghty & a man of grete renowne / that was called Dyoclesyā that wel & worthely hym gouerned & ruled thrugh hys noble cheualry. Soo that he conquered all the londes aboute hym / so that almoost al the kyn¦ges of y
e
 worlde to hym were attendaūt. ¶It befell thus that this Dyoclesyā spowsed a gen¦tyl damoysell that was wōder fayre / that was his vncles doughter Labana. & she loued hym as reason wolde / so that he gate vpō her .xxxiii daughters / of the whiche y
e
 eldest was called. A bine. And these damoyselles whā they came vnto aege became so fayre that it was wonder wherof Dyoclesyan anone lete make a somo∣nynge / & cōmaunded by his letters that all y
e
 kynges that helde of hym sholde come at a cer¦tayne daye / as in his letters were conteyned to make a feest ryall. At whiche daye thyther they came / & brought with theym Admyralles prynces and dukes / and noble chyualry. The feest was ryally arayed / and there they lyued in Ioye & myrth ynough / that it was wonder to wyte. And it befell thus / that Dyoclesyan thought to mary his doughters amonge al tho kynges that were at that solempnyte. ¶And so they spake & dyd / that Albine his eldest dou¦ghter & al her systers rychely were maryed vn¦to xxxiii. kynges / that were lordes of grete ho¦nour & of power at this solempnyte. And whā the solempnyte was doone / euery kynge toke his wyfe & ladde them in to theyr owne coūtre & there made them quenes. And it befell thus afterwarde that this dame Albine became so stoute & so sterne / that she tolde lytell pryce of her lorde / and of hym had scorne & dyspyte & wolde not do his wyll / but she wolde haue her owne wyl in dyuers maters. And al her other systers euery chone bare them so euyl agaynst theyr lordes that it was wonder to wyte. And for as moche that thē thought that theyr hus∣bondes were not of so hyghe parentage come as theyr 
fad
 But those kyng{is} that were theyr lordes / wolde haue chastysen them with fayre manere vpō al loue & frendshyp that they shol¦de amende theyr selfwylled condycyons. But all was for noughte / for they dyd theyr owne wyl in al thynge that thē lyked. & had of pow∣er. wherfore those .xxxiii. kynges vpon a tyme and ofte tymes bete theyr wyues. For they wē¦de that they wolde amende theyr tatches. And theyr wyckednesse. But of suche condycyons they were / that for fayre speche & warnynge / they dyd all y
e
 wors / & for betynges ofte tymes moche the wors. Wherfore the kynge that had wedded Albine wrote the tatches and condy∣cyons of his wyfe Albine / and sente the lettre to Dyoclesyan his fader. And whan the other kynges herde that Albines lorde hadde sente a lettre to Dyoclesyan. anone they sente letters sealed with theyr seales the condycyons & tat∣ches of theyr wyues. whan the kynge Dyocle∣syan sawe & herde so many playntes of his dou¦ghters. He was sore ashamed 
 & became won∣der angry and wrothe towarde his doughters and thought. howe he then̄e myght amende it that they so mysdyde. And anone sente his let∣ters vnto the .xxxiii. kynges that they sholde co¦me to hym: & brynge with theym theyr wyues euerychone at a certayne daye. For he wolde there chastyse theym of theyr wyckednesse / yf he myght in ony maner wyse. So the kynges came all at that tyme & day that then was set∣te bytwene hym and the kynges. Dyoclesyan receyued them with moche honoure / and ma∣de a solempne feest to all that were vnderneth his lordshyp. And the thyrde day after that so¦lempnyte / the kynge Dyoclesyan sente after his .xxxiii. doughters that they sholde come & speke with hym in his chābre. And whan they were come / he spake to them of theyr wycked∣nes & of theyr cruelte and spytefully them re∣preued & blamed / & to them he sayde. That yf they wolde not be chastysed / they sholde his lo¦ue lose for euermore. And whan the ladyes her¦de al this / they became abasshed & gretly asha¦med. And to theyr fader they sayde / that they wolde make al amendes and so they departed out of theyr faders chābre. And dame Albine that was the eldest syster ladde theym alto her chambre / & then made to voyde all that were therin so that no persone was amonge theym but she and her systers togyder. ¶Then sayd Albine. My fayre systers wel we know that y
e
 kynge our fader vs hath reproued shame and dyspysed / for bycause to make vs obedyen



vnto our husbondes. But certes that shall I neuer whyles that I lyue / sythe that I am co∣me of a more hygher kyng{is} bloode than myn husbonde. And whan she had thus sayde / alle her systers sayd the same. And thē sayd Albine well I wote fayre systers that our husbondes haue cōplayned vnto our fader vpō vs wher¦fore he hath vs thus foule reproued & dispised wherfore syster my counsell is / that this ny∣ghte whan our husbondes ben a bede / all we with one assente for to kytte theyr throtes and thenne we may be in peas of them And beter we now do this thynge vnder our faders po∣wer than other where elles. And anone all the ladyes consented and graunted to this coun∣sell. And whan nyght was comen / the lordes and ladyes went to bedde / And anone as theyr lordes were a slepe / they kette all theyr husbō∣des throtes / and so they slewe them all. whan that Dyoclesyan theyr fader herd of this thin∣ge / he became furyously wrothe agaynste hys doughters / And anone wolde them alle haue brente. But all the barons and lordes of Sir∣rie coūseyled not so for to do suche streytnesse to his owne doughters / but only sholde voyde the londe of them for euer more so that they ne¦uer sholde come ayen / and so he dyde. And Dy¦oclesyan that was theyr fader anone cōmaun¦ded them to go in to a shyppe / & deliuered to thē vytaylles for half a yere· And whan this was done / all the systers went in to the shyppe and saylled forthe in the see / & betoke all theyr fren¦des to Apolin that was theyr god. And so long they saylled in the see / tyll at the last they came and arryued in an yle / that was all wyldernes¦se. And whan dame Albion was come to that londe & all her systers. This Albyne went fyr∣ste forth out of the shyppe / & sayd to her other systers. For as moche sayde she as I am the el¦dest syster of all this company / & fyrst this lon¦de hathe taken / and for as moche as myn na∣me is Albine. I wyll that thys londe be called Albion / after myn owne name. And anone al her systers graunted to her wyth a good wyll Tho wente oute all the systers of the shyppe & toke the londe Albyon as ther syster called it. And there they wente vp & downe / and foūde neyther manne woman / ne childe / but wylde beestes of dyuerse kyndes. And whan the vy∣taylle were dyspended & they fayled / they fed¦de them with herbes and fruites in the season of the yere / and so they lyued as they best my∣ghte. And after that they toke flesshe of dyuer¦se beestes & became wonder fatte. And so they desyred mannes company / and mannes kyn∣de that thē fayled. And for hete they waxed wō¦der courageous of kynde / so that they desyred more mānes company than ony other solace and myrthe whā the deuyll that perceyued wē¦te by dyuerse countrees and toke a body of y
e
 ayre & lykynge natures shed of men / & cam in to the londe of Albyon / & laye by tho wym̄en & shadde tho natures vpon them & they concey∣ued / & after brought forth gyaūtes. Of y
e
 whi¦che one was called Gogmagog / and an other Longherigam And so they were named by dy¦uers names / & in this maner they came forth and were borne horryble gyaūtes in Albyon And they dwelled in caues and in hylles atte ther wylle And hadde the londe of Albyon as them lykyd / vnto y
e
 tyme that Brute arryued and came to Tornes that was in the yle of Al¦byon. And there this Brute cōquered and dy∣scomfyted the gyauntes abouesayde.




¶Explicit prima pars.






¶Here begynneth now how Brute was go∣ten / & how he slewe first his moder / & after his fader. And how he conquered Albyon / that af¦ter he named Brytayne after his owne name that now is callyd Englonde after y
e
 name of Engyst of Saxonie. ¶This Brute came in to Brytayne aboute the .xviii. yere of Hely.


BE it knowen that in the noble cytee of grete Troy / there was a noble knyght & a man of grete power that was called Ene¦as. And whan the cyte of Troy was loste & de¦stroyed thrugh them of Grece. Thys Eneas wyth all his meyne fledde thēs & came to Lom¦bardy. That thē was lorde & gouernoure of y
e
 londe a kyng that was called Latyne. And an other kynge there was that was called Turo¦celyne / that strongely warred vpon this kyn∣ge Latyne / that oftentymes dyde hym moche harme And whā this kynge Latyne herde that Eneas was come / he receyued hym with mo∣che honour / & him with helde for as moche as he had herde of hym / & wyst wel that he was a noble knyght & a worthy of hys body & of his dedes. This Eneas helped kyng Latyne ī his warre / And shortely for to telle / so well and so


worthely he dyde that he slewe Turocelyne / and discomfyted hym and all his people. And whan all this was done / kynge Latyne gaaf all that londe that was Turocelynes / to thys noble man Eneas in maryage wyth Lauyne his doughter y
e
 moost fayrest creatue that ony man wyst. And so they lyued togyder in yoy
 & myrthe all the dayes of ther lyftyme ¶And after Ascanius sone to Eneas wedded a wyf / & vpon her he gate a sone that was called Sil¦ueyne. And this Silueyne whan he coude so∣me reason of man / vnwetynge his fader and aenst his wyll aqueyted hym with a damoy∣sell that was cosyn to Lauyne that was kynge Latynes doughter y
e
 quene that was Eneas wyf / and brought the damaysell with chylde. And whan Ascanius his fader it wyst / anone lete enqueyre of y
e
 wysest maysters & of y
e
 gret¦test clerkes / what chylde the domoysell sholde brynge forth / & they answerde & sayd / that she sholde brynge forth a sone that shalde kylle bo¦the his fader & also his moder. And so he dyde. For his moder deyed in berynge of hym. And whan this childe was borne / his fader lete cal¦le hī Brute And the maysters sayd that he shol¦de do moche harme & sorowe in many dyuers places / and after he sholde come to grete ho∣nour and worshyp. This kyng Ascanius dey∣ed whan god wolde / and Silueyne his sone re¦ceyued the londe / & made hym wonderly well beloued amonge his people. And so whā Bru¦te that was Silueynes sone was .xv. yere ol∣de / he wente vpon a day with his fader for to play & solace. And as Brute sholde haue shot vnto an herte / his arowe myshappe and glā∣ced / and so there Brute slewe hys fader.




¶How Brute was dreuen out of the lon∣de / and how he helde hym in Grece.


ANd whan this myschaūce was befall all y
e
 people of the londe made sorowe ynough & were sore an angred. And for enche son there of they droue brute out of the lōde / & wolde not suffre hym among them. And whā he sawe that he myght not there abyde / he wē from thens in to Grece / and there he founde .vii. thousande men that were of the lygnage and kynred of Troy that were come of grete blood as the story telleth / as of men and wym¦men and chyldern / the whyche were all hollde in thraldome and bondage of the kynge Pan∣dras of Grece / for the dethe of Achilles that was betrayed and slayne at troy. This brute was a wonder fayre man and a stronge and a huge of his age and of gladde there and sem∣blaunt / and also worthy of body / & was well beloued amonge his people. Thys kyng Pan¦dras herde speke of his goodnes & his condici¦ons / and anone made hym dwelle wyth hym soo that brute became wonder preuy & moche beloued with the kynge / soo that longe tyme brute dwelled with the kynge So at the laste they of Troy and brute spake togyders of kyn¦red and of lygnage & of acquayntaunce / & the¦re playned them vnto Brute of ther sorowe & of ther bondage / & of many other shames that the kynge Pandras had them done. And vnto brute they sayde vpon a tyme. ye be a lorde of our lygnage & a strong man & a myghty 
 ye be our capytayne & lorde / and gouernoure / & we wyll become your men / & your cōmaundemē¦tes doo in all maner of thynges / & brynge vs out of this wretchednesse and bondage / & we wyll fyghte with the kynge for trouthe with y
e
 grace of the grete god / we shal hym ouercome and we shall make you kyng of the londe and to you doo homage / and of you we shall holde euer more. Brute had tho grete pyte of theyr bōdage that they were brought ī. And preu
ly wente then from the kynges courte and tho them that were of Troy / wente and put them in to woodes and in to moūtaynes and them there helde. And sente vnto kynge Pandras / that he sholde gyue them leue sauely for to wē¦de out of the londe / for they wolde noo l
nger dwelle in his bondage. The kynge Pandras wexed tho sore anoyed and tho swore that he sholde slee them euerychone / and ordeyned a grete power and wente to warde them all for to fyght. But Brute and his men māly them defended and fyerfly fought and slewe all the kynges men that none of them escaped / and toke the kynge and helde hym in pryson / and ordeyned counsell bytwen them what they my¦ghte done And some sayde that he sholde be put to dethe / and some sayde that he sholde be exi∣led out of y
e
 londe And some sayd / that he shol∣de be brēte. And tho spake a wyse kynght that was called Mempris / and sayd to Brute and to alle tho of Troy. yf kynge Pandras wolde yelde hym and haue his lyf. I counsell that he


gyue vnto Brute that is our duke & our soue¦rayne / his doughter Gennogen to a wyf / and in maryage wyth her an hōdred shyppes well arayed / and all his tresoure of golde & syluer of corne & of wyne / & as moche as we nede to haue of 
o thyng & other. & then̄e go we out of this londe / & ordeyned vs a londe elles where. For we nenōe of our kynred that come after vs shall neuer haue peas in this londe amōge theym of Grece. For we haue slayne so many of ther knyghtes and of other frēdes that euer more warre and contake sholde be among vs Brute tho and all his folke consented well to that counseyll. And this thynge they tolde to kyng Pādras. And he for to haue his lyf graū¦ted as moche as they axed / and anone gaf vn∣to Brute Gennogen his doughter to wyfe / & an hondred shyppes with asmoche / as them neded of all vytaylles / as afore was ordeyned Brute tho toke his wyfe and all his men / that forsoke the londe of Grece and went them vn¦to the see and had wynde & weder at theyr wyll and came y
e
 thyrde daye in to an Ile that was called Lorgers. Thys Brute anone sente of his men a londe for to espye the maner of the countree. And they founde an olde cyte all wa¦sted and forlet that was ther in nother mā ne woman / ne no thynge dwellynge / and in the mydeell of this cyte they founde an olde tem∣ple of a fayre lady that was called Dyana the goddesse. And they came ayen vnto Brute & tolde hym what they had seen and foūde. And they counselled hym to goo and doo sacrefyce vnto dame Dyana / for she was wōte to yeue answere of what euer men prayed her and na∣mely vnto them that her honoured with sacre¦fyce. Brute wente vnto that yamge and sayd Dyana noble goddesse that all thynge haste in thy myght and power / wyndes / waters. woo∣des / felde / and all thynge of the world / and all manere of beestes that theryn ben. To you I make my prayer / that ye me counseyll and tel∣le / where / and in what place: I shall haue a co¦uenable dwellynge for me and for my people and there I shal make in honour of you a well fayre temple and a noble / wherin ye shall al¦waye be honoured / whā he had done his pray¦er. Dyana answerd in this maner Brute say∣de she go euen forth thy waye ouer the see in io Frauce to warde the west / and there ye shall fynde an yle that is called Albyon / & that yle is be compassed all wyth the see / and noo man maye come ther in but it be by shyppes and in that londe were wonte to dwelle gyauntes / but now it is not soo / but all wyldernes. And that londe is destenyed and ordeyned for you and for your people.






¶How Corin became Brutes man / and how kynge Goffar was dyscomfyted.


THenne whan Brute had this answere of Dyana the goddes. Anone he lete y
e
 ancres wynde vp & sayled in to the hyghe see. And whan he & his men had saylled .xx. dayes and moo / they foūde fast besyed a cost of y
e
 see a thousande men of the lygnage & kynred of Troy. And ther souerayne & ther mayster of all was called Corin· And whan Brute wyste whens they were / he tho toke them wyth mo∣che Ioye in to hys shyppes / and ladde theym forth wiht hym Th{is} Corin there be came bru¦tes man & to hym dyde homage. And so longe they saylled forth in the see tyll they cam vnto Gascoyne. And anone they arryued in the ha¦uen of Lyegers & there they dwlled .viii. day∣es them for to rest. & ther saylles to amēde the¦re that it was nede. Tydynges soone came to kynge Goffar that was lorde of that lōde howe that moche people of straūge londe were arry¦ued in to his lōde in y
e
 hauen of Lyegres wher¦fore he was sore angreged & anoyed / that they came and arryued in his londe wythout his ly¦cence and his leue. And anone ordened hym a gret power for to dryue out brute & to destroye hym & all his people. But it was so that kyng Goffar was dyscomfyted & all his peple. And hym self fledde in to Fraūce / there for helpe & socour. And in that tyme regned in Fraunce ·xii. kynges / & an .xi. of them assembled a grete power for to helpe Goffar & for to fight ayest Brute. This Goffar dwelled with thē of fraū¦ce halfe a yere & more. And in the meane tyme whan Goffar was in Fraūce. Brute and his company destroyed all the londe of Gascoyne and lete take all the tresour that kyng Goffar had / & there lete brynge it all in to his shyppes And this Brute founde in that londe a fayry place and couenable / & there brute made a fay¦re castel and a stronge. ¶whan that this was done / kyng Goffar came from Fraunce and .xi. kynges with hym and brought wyth hym


.xx.M. men for to fyghte with Brute and his company and Brute had but .vii.M. & .CCC men. And neuertheles whanne the two hostes mette togyder. Brute folke thorugh helpe of hymself: & of Turin his cosen: and of Corin y
e
 well and manly hym defended: and fought so tyll that in lytell tyme they hadde slayne of the Frensshemen two thousande & mo. Anone all that were alyue fledde awaye. And in this ba∣taylle Turin Brutes cosyn was slayne. And Brute lete entere hym worthely whan he had space & leyser in the castell that he had made: & tho lete calle that same castell Toures: For by cause of the name of Turin that there was en¦tred. And yet vnto this day there is a noble cy¦te that is called Toures. And kynge Goffar wyste that Turin was deed he came agayne with his men: & after yaue a stronge bataylle vnto Brute. But brute & his men were so we¦ry for fyghtynge: that they myght noo lenger endure: but to megre hym & all his. And then Brute yede in to his castell with his men: and made the gates faste for to saue them: and for to take counsell amoage them what were best for to do. Brute and Corin gaaf counsell and ordeyned pryuely: that Corin sholde go oute & busshe him ī a wood tyll on the morne soo that in the mornynge whan that Brute sholde fy∣ghte with his enemyes: thenne Corin shold co¦me with his folke in the one syde: and slee and do all the harme that he myght. And in a mor∣nynge in the dawnynge of the daye Brute wē¦te out of the castell: and fyersely faughte with his enmyes: and they manly deffended them. But within a lytell tyme Brute and his folke slewe .viii. hondred of kynge Goffars men. Thenne came Corin with y
e
 busshement and smote to grounde he & his companye all those that wolde stonde or abyde. So that the kyng Goffar & his cōpany were dyscōfyted: & faste they began to flee And brute & Corin with ther cōpany fyersely them pursewed & slewe mo of them in y
e
 fleynge than they dyd in y
e
 batayll. And ī this maner Brute had the victory. and neuertheles brute made moche sorowe for his cosyn Turī that there was slayne & other also that he haded lost of his men. That is to saye. vii· hondred and .xv. The whiche nobly he en¦tered in the same castell of Toures / there whe¦re he had entered Turin his cosyn.






¶How Brute arryued at Totnesse in the yle thenne called Albyon / and of the bataylle that was betwixt Corin and Gogmagog.


SO whan all this was done Brute wol¦de no lenger there dwell / for to fyghte / nor for to lese no moo of his people. For kynge Goffars people myghte euery daye encreace / mo and moo. And Brutes lossened. And ther∣fore he toke all his men and wente vnto the see and had wende and weder at theyr wyll. And the fyfth daye after they arryued in an hauen at Totnesse / and came in to the yle of Albyon And there neyther man nor woman as the sto¦ry telleth they founde but Gyaūtes. And they dwelled in hylles & in caues. And Brute sawe the londe was fayre and at his lykynge. And was good also for hym and for his people / as Dyan a the goddesse hadde hym behyght. And therfore was Brute wonder gladde and lette assembled vpon a daye all his 
ol
e to make a solempne sacrefyce and a grete feest in honour & reuerence of Dyana the goddesse of the whi¦che he hadde counseyll fyrste for to come in to this londe. And thenne whan that they hadde ther solempnyte done / as they vpon a daye sa∣te at ther meete / there came in vpon them .xxx gyauntes & slewe of Brutes men .xxx. Brute and his men anone strete vp and faught with the gyauntes and slewe them euerychone exce¦pte one that was called Gogmagog. & he was mayster of all the Gyauntes. And he was strō¦ger and hygher than ony of other. And Brute kepte hym for by cause that he sholde wrestyll with Corin that was Brutes mā. Fo he was greter & hygher than ony of bruces men from the gyrdelstede vp warde. ¶Gogmagog and Corin vndertoke there for to wrestell. And so togyders they wente / and wrestlyd a longe ty∣me / but at the last Gogmagog Helde Corin so fast that he brake two rybbes of h
 syde wher∣fore Corin was sore angry. And there he toke Gogmagog betwixt his armes and cast hym downe vpon aroche / soo that Gogmagog bra¦ke all to peces / and soo he deyed an euell deth. And therfore the place is called vnto this day∣the saute of Gogmagog. ¶And thenne after Brute yaue alle that contree vnto Corin. And there Corin called it after his name Cor∣newayl
. And his men he called Cornewayl∣les / and so sholde men of tha countree be cal∣led


for euermore / And in that contree dwelled Corin and hys men. And they made townes and howses / and enhabyted the londe by theyr owne wyll






¶How Brute buylded London and cal∣led thys londe Brytayne / and Scotlonde Albyne / and walys Camber.




¶London.

BRute and his men wente forth / and sa∣we about in dyuers places / where that they myght fynde a good place and couenable that they myght make a Cyte for hym and his folke. And soo at the laste they came by a fayre Ryuer that is called Tamys and / there Bru∣te began to buylde a fayre cyte / and lete calle it newe Troy / in mynde and remembraunce of the grete Troy / from the whiche place all ther lygnage was comen. And this Brute lete felle downe woodes / and lete eere and sowe londes And also lete mawe downe medowes for suste¦naunce of hym and of his people. And thenne he departed the londe to theym / so that euery∣
he of theym had a parte / and a certayne place for to dwelle in. ¶And thenne Brute lette calle this londe Brytayne after his owne na∣me and his folke he lette calle Brytons. And this Brute had goten on his wyf Gennogen thre sones / that were worthy of dedes. The fyrst was called Lotrin / the seconde Albanak and the thyrde Cambar. And brute bare crow¦ne in the cytee of Troy .xx. yere after the tyme that the cytee was made. And there he made y
e
 lawes that the Brytons holde / and this brute was wonderly well beloued amonge all men. And Brutes sones also loued wonderly welle togyder· And whan Brute had sought all the londe in lengthe and also in brede he founde a londe that Ioyned to Brytayne / that was in the northe and that londe Brute yaue to Alba¦nak his sone. And lete calle it Albanie after his name / that nowe is called Scotlonde. And Brute founde an other countree towarde the weste / and yaue that to Cambar his other so∣ne / and lete calle it Cambar after his name / & now is called walys. And whan Brute hadne regned .xx. yere as before is sayd / then̄e he dey∣ed in the Cyte of newe Troy.






¶How Lotrin that was Brutes sone en∣tred with moche honoure / & gouerned the londe well and worthely.


AFter Brute regned Lotrī h{is} sone / that was the seconde kynge in Brytayne. The whiche began to regne the seconde yere of Samuell. And this Lotrin was crowned kynge wyth moche solempnyte and glorye of all the londe of Brytayne. And after whan he was crowned kynge. Albanak and Cambar his two brethern wente agayne into theyr ow¦ne countree & there they lyued with moche ho∣nour / & worshyp. And Lotrī theyr brother reg¦ned / & was kynge & gouerned it well & wysely for he was a good man & wonderly well belo∣ued of all his londe. And it befell so that Alba∣nak dwelled in his owne londe with moche ho¦noure and worshyp.

And anone he wente thens to his fyrste doughter agayne / but anone as she sawe hym come / she swore by god & by his holy name / & by as moche as she myght: that he sholde haue no moo with hym but one knyght \ yf he wolde there abyde. Then beganne Leyr to wepe. and made moche sorowe: and sayd then. Alas now haue I to longe lyued / that this sorowe & mys∣cheyf is to me nowe fallen. For now I am poo¦re: that somtyme was ryche. But nowe haue I noo frende ne kynne that to me wyll do ony good. But whan I was ryche all men me ho∣noured & worshyped & now euery man 
athe of me scorne & dyspyte. And now I well wote that Cordeill my yongest doughter sayde me trouth / whan she sayd. As moche as I had soo moche sholde I be loued. And all y
e
 whyle that I had good: so longe was I loued & honoured for my ryches. But my two doughters glosed me then: & now of me they set lytell pryce. and soth tolde me Cordeil: but I wolde not byleue it ne vnderstonde. & therfore I lete her goo fro¦me as a thynge that I sette lytell pryce of: and now wote I neuer what for to do syth my two doughters haue me thus dysceyued: that I so moche loued: & now must I nedes seke her that is in an other londe: that lyghtly I lete her go from me without ony rewarde of gyftes. And she sayde / that she loued me as moche as she ought to loue her fader by all maner of reason And then I sholde haue a

 quene anone toke golde and syluer plenty / & toke it to the squyre in coūsell that he sholde go & bere it to her fader / & that he sholde go in to a certayne cyte / & hym aray & wasshe / & then come agayne to her. And brynge with hym an honest company of knyghtes .xl. at y

Of kynge Gynder that was Kymba¦lyns sone / that wolde not paye the trua∣ge to Rome for the londe that Cassybo∣lon had graunted / and how he was slay∣ne of a Romyne.


ANd after the dethe of thys Kymbalyn regned Gynder his sone a good man and a worthy / and was of soo hygh herte that he wolde not paye to Rome that trybute that kynge Cassybolon had graūted vnto Iulius Cezar wherfore themperour that was tho that was called Claudius Cezar was sore anoyed And ordeyned a grete power of Romayns / & came in to this londe for to conquere the tribu¦te thrugh strengthe / and for to haue it on the kynge· But thys kynge Gynder and Arma∣ger his broder assembled & gadred a grete host

And the kynge gaf no kepe to his wordes / ne to his speche forbi cause of the armes that he hae vpō hym / and demyd that he hadde ben a Bryton. But the traytour euer helde hym next the kyn¦ge And pryuely vnder y

And for the armes they wende it had be kyng Gynder that afore was slayne / y

And after Armager wente to wyn¦chestre for to seke Claudius Cezar the Emper¦our of Rome. And there Armager hym tooke. And Claudius the emperour thorugh counseyl of the Romayns that were wyth hym left a ly¦ue / made peas with Armager ī this maner as ye shall here. That is to saye.

And vpō this couenaunt Claudius Cezar sent to Rome for his doughter Gennen. And as she was come Claudi{us} Cezar yaf her vnto Armager to wyf. & Armager spowsed her at Lōdon with moche solempnyte & myrth. And thenne was Arma∣ger crowned & made kynge of Brytayne.






¶Of kynge Armager in whose tyme. saynt Peter preched ī Anthyoche with other apostles in dyuers coūtrees.


THis Armager regned well and worthe¦ly / and gourned the londe ryght wor¦shypfully. ¶And Claudius Cezar in remem∣braūce of this accorde / and for reuerence and honoure of hys doughter made in this londe fayre town & a castell / and lete calle the tow∣ne after his name Clauestren / y

And Armager thenne was kin¦ge / and gouerned the londe well and worthely all his lyues tyme. And this Armager gate a sene on his wyf whiche was callyd westmer. And while that this Armager regned saint Pe¦ter preched in Anthioche And there he made a noble chirche. In the whiche he satte fyrste in hys chayre And ther he dewelled .vii. yere. and after he wente to Rome: and was made pope: tylle that Nero y

¶How kynge westmer gaaf to Berynger an ylonde forlet. And there this Berynger made the towne of Berwyke.


ANd after this Armager regned his so∣ne westmer: that was a good man and a worthy of body: and well gouerned the lon∣de. It befell so that tydynges came to hym vp∣on a daye: that the kynge Roderyk of Gascoy¦ne was come in to thys londe wyth an hughe host of peple: & was dwellyng in Scanys mo∣re. & whā kyng westmer herde those tydynges he lete assemble an huge host of Brytons / & ca¦me to the kynge Roderyk & yaue hym batayll. And kynge westmer slewe kynge Rodoryke wyth hys owne hondes in playne baytaylle. ¶And whan kyng Roderyks men sawe that


ther lorde was slayne / they yelded them all to kyng westmer / & became his men for euer mo¦re. And he gaf them a coūtree that was forletē wherin they myghte dwelled. ¶And thyther they wente And dwelle there alle theyr lyues tyme / and .ix. hondred men there were of the¦ym & nomoo lefte at that batayll· Theyr go∣uernour & prynce was called Berynger. And anone he began a towne that they myght ther in dwelle & haue resorte and lete calle the tow∣ne Berwyk vpon Twede. And there they en∣habyte & becam ryche. But they had no wym¦men amonge them / & the Brytons wolde not yeue there doughters to the straūgers. wherfo¦re they wēte ouer see in to Irlonde / & brought with them wymmen & there they them spo

¶How kyng westmer lete arere a stone in the entrynge of westmerlōde / there that he slewe Roderyk / & there he began fyrste housynge.


ANd after this batayl that is aboue say∣de whan Roderyke was deed / kynge westmer in remembraunce of his victory lete arere there besyde the way a grete stone on hy¦ghe / and yet it stondeth & euer more shall ston¦de. And he lete graue ī y

And whan westmer had so done he dwelled all his lyf tyme in that countree of westmerlonde / for he loued that coūtree more than ony other coūtre / & whan he had regned .xxv. yere / he deyed and lyeth at Karleyll.






¶Of kynge Coill that was westmers sone that helde his londe in peas al his lyues tyme.


AFter this: his sone kynge Coill regned a good man & a worthy: and of goode condycyons: and well gouerned hys londe. And of all men he hadde loue and peas. And in his tyme was neuer contake debate: nor war∣re in Brytayne. And he regned and was kyn∣ge in peas all his lyues tyme· And whā he had regned .xi. yere he deyed & lyeth at yorke.


CLaudius was Em{per}our at Rome nexte after Gaius. And he regned .xiiii. yere / and .viiii. dayes.

And this kyng Lucie made tho in thys londe two Archibys∣shops: one at Caunterbury an other at yorke & other many bisshops that yet bē in this londe And whan these two Legat{is} had baptysed all this londe: they ordeyned prestes for to bapty∣se chyldern: and for to make the sacramente: and after they wente ayen to Rome. And the kynge dwelled in his londe: and regned wyth moche honoure .xii. yere: and after deyed and lyeth at Gloucestre.

THis kyng Lucie had none heyre of his body begotē: that was after warde gre¦te harme & sorowe to the londe. For after thys kynge Lucies deth: none of the grete lordes of the londe wolde suffre an other to be kynge: but lyued in warre & debate amōges them self .l. yere without kyng. But it befell after war∣de that a grete prince came from Rome ī to th{is} londe that was called Seuerie: not for warre but for to saue the ryght of Rome. But neuer theles he had not dwelled halfe a yere in thys londe but that the Brytons slewe hym. And whan they of Rome wyst that Seueri was so slayne: they sente an other grete lord in to this londe that was called Allec that was a stron∣ge man & a myghty of body & dwelled in thys londe longe tyme & dyde moche sorowe to the Brytons. So that after for pure malyce: they chose a kynge amonge theym that was called Astelepades. And assembled a gr

Brytons: & wente to London to seke Allec: & there they foūde hym & slewe hym & all his fe¦lowes. And one that was called walon deffen¦ded hym fyersly: & fought longe with the Bry¦tons but at the last he was dyscomfyted and the Brytons tooke hym and bonde hys hondes & feet and cast hym in to a water. wherfore that water was called euer more walbroke. Tho regned Astelepades in peas: tyll one of his Er¦les that was called Coill made a fayr towne a¦yenste the kynges wyll: & lete calle the towne Colchestre after hys owne name. wherfor the kyng was full wroth & thought to destroy him And began to warre vpon hym and brought grete power of men and yaf the Erle batayll. And the Erle defended hym fyersly wyth hys power & slewe the kynge hymself in that bata¦yll. And tho was Coill crowned & made kyng of this londe. This Coill regned and gouere∣ned the londe well & nobly / for he was a noble man and well be loued amonged the Brytons. ¶whan tho of Rome herde that Astelepades was slayne: they were wonder gladde: & sente an other grete prynce of the Romayns y
t
 was called Cōstance. And he came to y
e
 kyng Coill for to chalēge the trybute that was wōte to be payed to Rome. And y
e
 kynge answered well & wisely & sayde: that he wolde paie to Rome all that ryght and reason wolde with good wyll. And so they accorded tho with good wyll and without ony cōtake. And so both they dwelled 
togyd
 in loue. ¶Kynge Coill yaaf to hym his doughter Eleyne for to haue her to his spow∣se / that was bothe fayre & wyse & good & well lettred. & this Cōstance spowsed her there with moche honoure.

 one was called Hoell an another was called Taberne / and the thyrde Morhyn And toke alhys londe to kepe vnto the Erle of Corne wayle that was called Octauyan. And soo anone as thys Octauyan wyste that hys lorde dwelled at Rome.

And they ar∣rayued at Por tesmouth. ¶And whan Octa¦uyan wyst that he assembled a grete power of Brytons and dyscomfyted Taberne & Taber∣ne


fledde thens in to Scotlonde. and ordeyned there a grete power / and came ayne in to thys londe another tyme to yeue batayll to Octaui¦an. ¶whan Octauian herde that / he assem∣bled a grate power & came to warde Taberne as moche as he myght / soo that those two hos∣tes mette togyders vppon Stanesmore / and strongely smote togyder / & tho was Octaui∣an dyscōfyted / & fledde thens vnto Norwaye.

¶How Constantyne that was the kyn¦ges brother of lytell Brytayne was crowned kyng of grete Brytayne / for hys grete vertue and hys grete worthynesse.

e
 last no man wyst where he was become. ¶whan the kynges mē wyst that the¦yr lorde was so deed they made then so moche sorowe that they wyst not what to do. For as moche as his two sones Aurilambros & Vter


were so yonge / that they myght not be kynge / and the thyrde was a mōke as is sayd before. But Vortiger that was Erle of westsex thou∣ghte preuely in hys herte thrugt queyntaunce for to be kyng hymselfe. And went to wynche¦stre / where that Constance was monke / and sayde vnto hym. Constance sayde he / your fa∣der is deed & your two brethern that ben wyth Gosselyn y

And Vortyger lete slee hym for to be kyn¦ge hymselfe.


THys Vortyger coūselled thys Constan¦ce so moche / tyll he forsoke hys abbot & wēte with him. And anone after he was crow¦ned kynge by thassent of the Brytons. Thys kynge Constance whan he was crowned and made kyng / he wyst ne knewe but lytell of the worlde ne cude nothynge what knyghthode axed· And he made vortiger his chyef mayster and coūseyller / & gaf hym all his power / for to-ordeyne & do as moche as to y

 reame apertey¦ned. So that hymself no thynge entermedled but only bare the name of kynge. whan Vor∣tiger sawe that he had all the londe in his war¦de & gouernall / he thought a preuy treason to slee Constance the kynge / that he myght hym self be crowned & made kynge & regne. And le¦te sende after an hōdred kynghtes of Pehites the worthyest of all y

And Vorty∣ger tolde them / yf he myght be kynge / ye as it were thrugh treason / he wolde make them ry∣chest of the londe. Soo at the laste thrugh gre∣te gyftes that he had gyuen largely they cryed thrugh the courte that Vortyger were beter worthy to be kynge than Constance. wherfore Vortiger made semblaunt as he had ben wro¦the. And he departed thens from the courte: & sayde he must goo elles were for thynges that he hadde to do. And soo the traytour sayde for by cause that they sholde slee hym: that ys to saye Constance. ¶whan thys Vortyger was gone: yt befell soone after: y

Brytons / & tho went ayenst Engyst for to yeue hym Batayll & hys folke. But Engist dradde hym sore of the Bry¦tons for they had dryuen hym before & discom¦fyted hym with strēgth. wherfore this Engist prayed hym for a loue daye / & sayd he was not comen in to this londe for to fyght / but for to haue hys lond ayen yf he myght accorde with the. Brytons / & of them to haue loue and grace The kynge Vortiger thrugh counseyll of hys Brytons graūted hym a loue daye. And thus it was ordeyned thrugh the Brytons / y
t
 the sa¦me daye sholde be holden fast besyde Salysbu¦ry vpon a hylle. And Engyst sholde come thy∣der with four hordred kdnghtes without moo And the kyng with as many of the wysest men of hys londe· And at that daye the kynge came with his coūseyll as it was ordeyned / but En¦gist had warned hys knyghtes pryuely / & then conmaunded that euery one of them shold put a longe knyf in hys hose. And whan he sayde Fayre syres now ys tyme to speke of loue & pe∣as euery man Anone shold drawe out hys kyn¦ue & slee a Bryton. And so they slewe. a M.lxi. knyghtes / & wyth moche sorowe many of them escaped. And the kyng vortyger there hymself tho was taken / & ladde to Thongcastell & put in pryson. And some of Engystes men wolde that the kynge had be brente alle quycke And vortiger tho for to haue hys lyf / graūted them as moche as they wolde are / & yaue vp all the londe townes / castelles / cytees / & borughs to Engist and to his folke. And all the Brytons fledde thes in to waiys / and there they helde them styll. And Engyst wente thorugh the lon¦de and seased all the londe / wyth fraunchyles And in euery place lete cast a downe chyrches and houses of Relygyon / And wasted and de∣stroyed crystendome thrughout all thys londe And lete 
aunge y
e
 nam of thys lond called bry¦tayne: that noo man of hys were soo hardy af∣ter that tyme to calle this lōde Brytayne: but calle Engist londe. And then ne he departed all the londe to hys men: and there made .vii. kynges for to strength the londe that the Bry¦tons sholde neuer after come therem. ¶The fyrst kyngdome was Kent: there that Engist hymself regned: and was lorde & mayster ouer al y
e
 other. ¶The other kyng had Southsex y
t
 now is called chychestre ¶The thyrdet kyng had westsex. ¶The fourth had Eestsex. The fyfth had Estangill: y
t
 now is called Northfol¦ke Southfolke. Merchemeryk: that ys to saye therldome of Nycholl. ¶The sixth had Ley∣cheter shyre. Northampton shyre. Herforde: and Huntyngdon. ¶The seuenth hadde Ox enforde. Glouchestre. wynchestre. wer wyke∣and Derbyshyre.






¶How that Vortyger wente in to walys & beganne there castell y
t
 wolde not stande wyth out morter tempred wyth blood.


AS Engist had departed all the lond in thys maner bytwene hys men: and in lyuerde vortyger out of pryson & suffred hym freely to go whyther that he wolde. And he to∣ke his waye and wente in to walys there that his Brytons dwelled: for as moche as y
e
 londe was stronge & wycked to wynne. And Engyst 
neuer came therene neuer knew it before that londe. ¶Vortiger helde hym there wyth hys Bratons / and axed counseyll what hym was best to do. And they yaue hym counseyll to ma¦ke a stronge castell that hym myghte hymself there in kepe and defende yf nede were. Ma
e sons in haste tho were fette / & began to werke vpon y
e
 hylle of Breigh / but certes thus it be∣fell that all the werke that the masons made a daye downe it felle the nyght / and they wyste not what it myght be. Ther of the kynge was sore anoyed of that chaunce & wyste not what to do. werfore he lette sende after the wysest clerkes & also lerned men than were thorugh out walys that myght be foude / for they shol∣de tell wherfore y
e
 foūdament so fayled vnder the werke / and they sholde hym tell what was best for to doo. And whan these wyse men lon∣ge tyme had studyed they sayde to the kynge / that he sholde doo seke a chylde borne of a wo∣man that neuer had with man to do And that chylde sholde be slayne / and tempred with his blood the morter of the werke. And soo sholde the werke euer endure withouten ende.








¶How the kynge lette seke. Merlyn thorugh out all walys / for to speke wyth hym.


AS the kynge herde this he commaun∣ded his messagers anone to go thrugh out walys to seke that chylde yf they myghte hym fynde / and that they sholde hym brynge forthe with them vnto hym. And in recorde & in wytnesse of thys kynge he hadde take them his letters that they ne were distroubled of no▪ man ne lette. And tho the messengers wente thens / and spedde soo faste that they came in to a towne that was called Carmardyne / and as they passed for the theyr waye they founde two chyldern of .xxiiii· yere of aege thydynge togyder with hasty wordes. And one of them sayde to that other Donebat sayde he ye do all wronge to chyde or stryue with me for ye haue no wytte ne no reason as I haue. Certes mer∣lyn sayde he / of your wytte ne youre reson. I make no force. For men telle comynly that ye haue no thynge of god all myghty syth ye had neuer fader / But euery man knoweth who was youre moder. ¶The messengers of the kynge vortiger whan they herde the stryue be∣twixt the two gromes they axed of them that stode besyde them whens that· Marlyn was borne / and also whom hym nourysshed. And the folke them tolde / that a greate gentyll wo∣man hym bare in. Carmadyne that was cal∣led Adhanr But neuer myght noth man wyte who was his fader. ¶whan the kynges mes∣sengers herde these tydynges they wente ano∣ne to hym that was wardeyne of the towne & tolde hym the kyng{is} wyll and shewed hym his leter wherfore they were come thyder.


¶Merlyn and his moder were fetched be∣fore the wardeyne of the towne. And he com∣maunded them that they sholde go to the kyn∣ge as it was ordeyned by his messagers. Mer∣lyn and his moder wente thens and came vn∣to y
e
 kynge and there they were receyued with moche honour. And the kynge axed of that la∣dy yf y
e
 chylde were her sone & whome hym be gate. The lady answered full tenderly wepyn¦ge and sayde. She neuer hadde company of worldly man. But syr sayde she As I was a yonge mayden in my faders chambre / and o∣ther of greate lygnage were in my company / that oftentymes wente to place and solace. I belefte alone in my chambre / wolde not goo 
orthe for bernnynge of the sonne. And on
 tyme there came a fayre bacheler and entred in my chambre there that I was alone. But how he came in to me / and where. I wyst it ne¦uer \ ne yet knowe I not. For the doores were fast barred and with me he dyde game of loue For I ne had myght ne power / hym to defen- from me. And often he came vnto me in y
e
 for∣sayd maner / so that he begate this childe. But neuer myght I wyte what he was.






¶Of the answere of Merlyn wherfore the kynge axed why his castel myght not stonde that he had begonne ne proue.


SO whan Merlyn hadde herde all that his moder hadde sayd. He spake to the kynge in this maner. ¶Syre how I was begoten axe ye no more For it be falleth not to you ne to none other to wyte. But telle me the cause wherfore I am to you brought & wher∣fore ye haue sente after me. ¶Truely sayd the kyng / my wyse couseyllers haue done me to vnderstode / y

e
 morter of a werke that I haue begonne / behouety to be thempred with your blood / or the foundament shall fayle for euer more. ¶Syr sayd Merlyn. wyll ye slee me for my blood to tempre with your morter. ye sayd the kyng / or elles my castell shall neuer stande as my coūseyllers do me to vnderstonde Tho- answerd Merlyn to the kyng. Syr he sayd he sayd / lete them come before me those wyse coū¦seylles & I woll preu they saye not well ne tru∣ly. And whan y
e
 wyse men were comen. Mer∣lyn axed yf his blod were y
e
 cause to make this werke to stōde & endure. All tho wyse men we∣re abasshed & coude not answere. Merlyn tho sayd to the kynge. Syr I shall tell you y
e
 cause wherfore your werke thus fayleth & may no
 stande. There is vnder the moūtayne there y
t
 ye haue buylded youre toure a grete ponde of water & ī y
e
 botome of y
e
 ponde vnder y
e
 water there ben two dragons / & y
e
 one is whyte & y
e
 o¦ther reede / y
e

togyd
 ayēst your werke do ye myne depe eyll your men come to y
e
 pond / & cause your men to take a way y
e

e
 dragans as I haue you tolde y
e
 togyder fyght ayēst your werke & this is the cause wherfor your foūdament fayleth The kynge anone lete dygge vnder that men came to the ponde / And lette doo a waye the water / and there they founde two dragons as Merlyn had tolde that egerly fought togyder The whyte dragon egerly assayled the reede


and lyadde on hym so strongely that he myght not endure / but withdrewe hym and rested in the same caue. And whā he had a whyle rested hym / he wente before & assayled the reede dra∣gon angerly / & helde hym soo sore y
t
 he myght not ayenste hym endure / but withdrewe hym & rested And after came ayen y
e
 whyte dragon and strongly fought wyth the reede dragon. & bote hym euyl & ouercame. that he fledde from thens and nomore came agayne.






¶Of the sygnycacyon of those two dragons that were in the botome of the ponde that fought togyder


THis kynge vortyger and hys men that sawe thys batayll had grete meruaysle and prayed Merlyn to tell him what it myght betoken. Syr quod Merlyn I shall telle you. The reede dragon betokeneth yourselfe / and the whyte betokeneth the folke of Saxon that fyrste ye toke & helde in your londe that fyght ayenst you / and you haue dryuen & enchaced. ¶But Brytons of ynure lygnage ouercame them and droue them a waye And sythen at y
e
 comynge ayen of the Saxons they recouered this londe and helde it for euer more. And dro¦ue out the Brytons and dyde wyth this londe all they wyll / and destroyed crystēdom thrugh out thys londe. ye had fyrste grete Ioye wyth theyr comynge / But now yt ys torned to you grete damage and sorowe. For tho brethern of Constance that was kynge the whiche ye le¦te slee shal come before a quīzeme passed with a grete power from lytell Brytayne / & shall a¦uenge the deth of theyr brother. And they shal brenne you fyrst wyth sorowe / and after they shall slee a grete parte of Saxons / & shall dry∣ue out all the remenaūt of the londe. And ther¦fore abyde ye here noo lenger to make castell nor other werke. But anone goo elles where youre lyues alle for to saue. To god I you betake / trouthe I haue sayde to you of thyn∣ges that shalle befalle. ¶And vnderstande ye welle that Aurilambros shalle be kynge But he shalle be enpoysoned / and lytell tyme shall he regne






¶Of kynge Aurilambros how that he pursued vortiger and Engist and how they deyed.


MErlyn and hys moder departed frome the kynge / and torned agayne to Car∣mardyn. And soone after tydynges came to y
e
 Brytons that Aurilambros and vter his bro¦ther were arryued at Totnesse wyth a greate hoste / And anone the Brytons assembled thē and wente to receyue Aurylambros and Vter wyth grete noblesse. And had them vnto Lon¦don / and crowned Aurylambros & made hym kynge / and dyde vnto hym homage. And ano¦ne he axed where. Vortyger that was kynge myght be founde / for he wolde be auenged on his brothers dethe / and after he wolde warre vpon paynems. And they tolde hym that Vor¦tyger was in walys / & soo they ladde hym thy¦ther warde. ¶Vortiger wyste welle that tho brethern came hym to conquere / And fledde thens in to a castell that was called. Gerneth that stode vppon an hyght mountayne / and there hym helde. Aurilambros and Vter hys brother and theyr folke had besyeged the ca∣stell full long tyme / for the cagell was stron∣ge and well arrayed. ¶So at the laste they ca¦sted wylde fyre and brente howses and men & all theyr araye: and as moche as was wythin the castell. Soo that Vortiger was brente a∣monge all other: and soo he deyde wyth moche sorowe. ¶Tho was Engist in Kente and reg¦ned there: ane herde thys tydynges: and ano∣ne fledde and wolde haue gone in to Scotlon¦de for to haue had socoure. But Aurilambros and his men mette with hym in the north coū¦tre and yane hym batayl. And Engist and his men defended whyles that they myghte. But he and his folke were discomfyted and slayne And Octa his sone fledde vnto yorke. And Au¦rilambros hym folowed egerly. And. Octa a lytell whyle withstode hym: But after warde he put hym to his mercy. And aurilambros re¦ceyued hym: and to hym and to hys men gaaf∣the countree of Galewaye in. Scotlonde: and there they dwelled. ¶The kyng aurilambros wente thorugh out the londe: and put awaye the name of. Englonde: that. Engist after hys name had called it befoere. Tho lete he it calle agayne grete. Brytayne: and lete make ayen cherches: houses of religyon: castelles: cytees and broughs. And towones that the. Saxons hadde destroyed. And came to London: and le¦te make the walles of the cyte: whyche Engist and his folke hadde castedowne. ¶The Bry¦tons ladde hym vnto the mount of. Ambrian that somtyme was an hous of relygyon: that tho was destroyed thrughe the paynems:


¶wherof a knyght that was called Ambri sometyme was founder of that house. And ther¦fore the same hylle was called the mount of. Ambrian. And after it was called. Ambresbu∣ry. And shall be so for euermore
.






¶How Aurilambros dyde redresse the londe of greate Brytayne / that whyche was destroyed thorugh the Saxons before sayde.


HOw the kynge Aurilambros lete amen¦de and redresse the house of Ambresbu∣ry / and there in put monkes. But now there ben Nonnes a lytell fro the place that was cal¦led Salysbury / are that the Saxons slewe the Brytons / where Engist and they shold haue made a laue daye. In the whyche tyme were slayne a thousande knyghtes .lxi. thrugh trea∣son of Engist· The kynge therof had grete py¦te and thoughte to make in mynde of them a monument of stone that myght endure to the worldes ende. And of thys thynge they tooke ther counseyll what therof was best for to do. ¶Tho spake to the kynge the bysshop of Lon¦don that was called Ternekyn that he sholde requyre after. Merlyn. For he coude best telle how this thyng myght best be made. And mer¦lyn after was sought and founde and came to the kyng. And the kynge tolde hym hys wyll of the monumente that he wolde haue made. Merlyn answered to the kynge & sayd. There ben grete stones in Irlonde and longe vpon the hylle of Kyan that men called. Gyauntes karoll. And yf they were in this place as they ben there / they wolde endure for eurer more in remembraunce of those knyghtes that here be entyred. ¶Per may foy sayd the kynge as har¦de stone ben in my londe as in Irlonde.


¶Soth sayde Merlyn. But in all your londe ben none suche. For gaūtes sette them for gre∣te good of themself. For atte euery tyme that they were woūde or in ony maner hurte / they wysshe the stones with hote water / And then∣ne they wysshe them ther with and anone they were hoole.






¶How the Brytons wente for to seke the grete stones in Irlonde.


AS soone as the. Brytons had herde of this thynge / they yede and swore amō¦ge them they wolde go seke those stones. And toke with them. Vter the kynges broder to be thyef capytayne and .v. thousande men / and Merlyn counselled them for to go vnto Irlon¦de and soo thye dyde / And whan the kynge of Irlonde that was culled Guillomer herde tell straungers were arryued in his londe / he assē¦bled a grete power & fought ayenst them But he & his folke were dyscomfyted. ¶The Bry∣tons went before tyll they came to the mount of Kyan / and clymmed vp vnto the mounte. But whan they sawe the stones & the maner how they stode / they had grete meruaylle and sayde bytwene themself / that noo man sholde them remeue for noo strengthe ne engyne soo grete they were and soo longe. But. Merlyn thrugh his crafte he remeued them and brou∣ghte them in to theyr shyppes and came ayen in to thys londe. And Merlyn sette the stones there that the kyng wolde haue them. And set∣te them in the same manner that they stode in Irlonde / and whan y
e
 kynge sawe that it was made he thanked Merlyn / And rychely hym rewarded at his owne wyll. And that place le¦te calle Stonhenge for euer more.






¶How Passent that was Vortigers sone and the kynge Guillomer came in to thys londe / and how a traytour that was called Cappa enpoysoned y
e
 kynge Aurilambros.


ANd men shall vnderstonde that Pas∣sent that was Vortigers sone lyued y
e
 same tyme / and came in to thys londe wyth a grete power / and arryued in the north coūtre & wolde be auēged of his faders deth Vortiger and strongely trusted vpon the company that he had brought wyth hym out of the londe of Germayne / and had conquered all the North countree vnto yorke. ¶And whan kynge Au∣rilambros herde this he assemled a grete pow¦er of Brytons & went for to fyght with passēt & he dyscomfyted Passent & all his peple. but Passent escaped thens with some of his men / & fledde thens in to Irlonde & come to kynge Guillomer & prayed hym of helpe and socour. The kynge graūted hym with good wyll and sayde / that he wolde helpe hym / vppon that couenaunt that I my selfe muste go with you with all my power in to brytayne. And I wol∣de me aduenge vpon the Broytons the rather for they came in to my londe & toke the stones with strength that is called Gyauntes karoll ¶The kyng Guillomer lete ordeyne his ship¦pes & went to the see with .xv. thousāde men


and arryued in walys & began to robbe / & mo¦che sorowe he dyde. ¶It befell so that kynge Aurilambros laye syke at wynchestre / & my∣ghte not helpe hym self. So that he sente in his name Vter his brother with a power to helpe walys. And thyther warde he went as moche as he myght. ¶The kynge of Irlonde & Pas∣sente herde telle that Aurilambros was syke / & to hym there came a Sarrasyn that was cal∣led Cappa & sayde. Syre dwelle ye here all in peas with your host & I behyght you thorugh my quayntesye y
e
 I shall slee the kynge Auri¦lambros that is syke. Thenne sayd Passent / yf ye doo so I shall you rychely auaunce. The traytour Cappa put vpon hym an habyte of relygyon / & lete shaue hym a brode crowne & came vnto the kynges courte / and sayde that he wolde help
 the kynge of his malady. Tho sayd the traytour Cappa vnto the kyng. Syr be of good comforte. For I shall yeue you su∣che a medicyne that ye shalle swete anōe ryght & lyste to slepe & haue good reste. And the tray∣tour yaaf hym suche poyson to slepe anone ry¦ghte / & deyed in hys slepynge. And y
e
 traytour sayd y
t
 he wolde go out to the felde tyll he were awaked / & so escaped he awaye. For no man had to hym suspeccyon / for by cause of his ha∣byte that he was clothed ī / & also for hys brode shauen crowne. But whan the kynges men wyste that he was deed / they became wonder sory / and faste soughte the traytoure / but they myghte not fynde hym· For y
e
 Cappa torned ayen vnto the hoste frem whes y
t
 he came.






¶whan Aurilambbros deyed a sterre in the morne was seen wyth a clere lyght / & at the bought of the beeme was sene the heed of an horryble dragō


SO whan the kyng Aurilambros was deed & enpoysoned at winchestre. On the morne after he was dede aboute the tyme of Pryme there was sene a sterre grete & clere & the beeme of that sterre was brygheter thā y
e

e
 beeme apperyd a dragons heed / & out of hys mouth came two huge lyghtes / that were as bryght as ony fyre brennynge. & that one beeme to warde Fraun∣ce and streyght ouer the see thyther warde. And out of that beeme came .vii. beemes full clere and longe as it were the lyghte fyre. ¶This 
erre was seen of many a man / But none of them wyste what it be tokened. ¶Vter that was the kynges brother / that was in walys wyth hys hoste of Brytons / sawe that sterre & the grete lyght that it yaue / they wondred ther of gretly what it myghte betoken. And lete cal¦le Merlyn and prayed hym for to telle what y
t
 it myhght betoken.






¶Of the betokenynge of the sterre.





MErlyn sawe y
e
 sterre / and be∣helde yt a longe tyme. And sythen he quoke and wepte tenderly. And sayde· Alas alas that soo noble a kyng & worthy ys deed And I do iou to vnderstān∣de that Aurilambros your brotherds poyso¦ned / & that I see well in thys sterre. And your∣selfe ys betokened the heed of the dragon that is seen at the bought of the beeme that ys your self that shall be kynge and regne. And by the beeme that stondeth to warde the Eest ys vn∣derstonde that ye shall gete a sone that shall con¦quere all Fraunce / and all the londes that be∣longeth to the crowne of Fraunce / that shalle be a wrothyer kynge & of more honoure than euer were ony of his auncetours. ¶And by the beeme that stretched towarde Irlonde is betokened that ye shalle gete a doughter that shalle be quene of Irlonde. ¶And the seuen beemes betoken that ye shall haue .vii. sones. And euery one of them shall be kyng / and reg∣ne wyth moche honoure. And abyde ye no len∣ger here / but goo and yeue batayll to your en∣myes / and fyghte wyth them booldely for ye shalle ouercome them and haue the victory. ¶Vter thanked hertely Merlyn and toke his men and wente to warde hys enmyes / & they fought togyder mortally / and soo he dyscom∣fyted his enmyes & them destroyed. And hym self slewe Passēt that was vortigers sone And his Brytons slewe Guillomer that was kyng of Irlonde and all his men. ¶And Vter ano∣ne after that batayll toke hys waye to warde wynchestre / for to doo entyere Aurilambros kynge that was his brother. But tho was the body borne vnto. Stonhenge with moche ho∣nour / that he had done make in remembraū∣ce of the Brytons that there were slayne thrugh treason of Engist / that same day that


they sholde haue ben accorded. And in the sa∣me place they entyered. Aurelambros the se∣conde yere of hys regne wyth all y

¶Of Vter Pendragon / and therfore he was called so ye shall here. And how he was ouertake with the loue of Igreyne that was the Erle of Cornewaylles wyf.


AFter the dethe of. Aurilambros. Vter his brother was crowned and regned well & worthely. And in remembraunce of the dragon that he was lykened to / He lete make two dragons thrugh coūseyll of his. Brytons And made that one for to be borne before hym whā he wēte in to batayll / and y
e
 other for to a¦byde att wynchestre in the bysshop chyrche. And for that cause he was called euer after v∣ter Pendragon. ¶And Octa that was Engis¦tes sone cōmended vter but lytell y
t
 was made newe kynge. And ayenste hym began to meue warre. And ordeyned a grete power of his frē¦des & of hys kynne / and of. Ossa hys brother \ and had taken all the londe from Humbre vn∣to yorke / But those of yorke helde strongely a¦gaynst them / and wolde not suffre them to co∣me in to the cytee / neyther to yelde the cytee to them. And he besyeged the towne anone ryght and yaue therto a stronge assawte. But they of the cyte them kept well & strongely. ¶And whan vter herd therof / he came thyther wyth a grete stronge power for to helpe & rescowe y

e
 laste they were dyscōfyted & the most partye of thē slay∣ne. And. Octa and. Ossa were taken & put in pryson at London. ¶And vter hymfelf dwel¦led a whyle atte yorke / and after he wente to London. And at the Eester after he wold vere crowne & holde a solempne feest. And lette so∣mone all his Erle and Barons / that they shol¦de come to that feest. And all those that hadde wyues sholde brynge them also to that feest. And all the seygnoury came at the kynges cō∣maundemente as they were commaunded. ¶The feest was rychely arayed and holden. And all worthely sette to meete after that they were of astate. Soo that the· Erle Gorloys of Cornewaylle and. Igreyne his wyf sate nexte vnto the kynge. And whan the kyng sawe the fayrnesse of that lady and the beaute that she had. He was anone rauysshed for her beaute and often he made to her nyce countenaunce in lokynge and laughynge. So at the laste the Erle perceyued the preuy lokynge and laug∣hynge and the loue bytwene them. And roso vp from the table in wrathe / and toke his wyf

And the erle wolde not come agayne in no maner of wyse. ¶wherfore the kynge was wrothe / and in wrathe hym defy∣ed as his deedly enmye. ¶And the erle wente thens in to Cornewaylle with his wyfe in the castell of Tyntagyll. ¶And the kynge lete or∣deyne a grete host and came in to Cornewayl¦le / for to destroye the erle yf that he myghte.

And whan thys was do¦ne and dyscomfyted hym Arthur torned hym ayen there that he was: in to the place there that he had lefte the Scottes and wolde haue them all slayne. But the bysshopes: abbottes and other folke of y

Syre gentyll kynge & myghty: haue mercy and pyte vpon vs. And as yourself be of the ryght lawe to holde and mayntene Crystendome. For full grete dysho¦udur yt shold be to slee hym that byleueth in al¦myghty god as ye do. And for goddes loue ha∣ue mercy and pyte on vs & suffre vs. For we haue hadde moche sorowe and payne.

And he became so curtys and large & honora¦ble / that the Emperours courte of Rome / ne none other thrugh out all the worlde was not accoūted to kyng Arthurs / that ony mā wyst of / ne none soo well praysed· And therfore the beste knyght{is} of all maner a londes came vnto hym there for to dwelle. And he theym recey∣ued with good wyll and reuerence. ¶And all the knygehtes were so good that noo man kne¦we the werste.

And there was so moche people in the cyte that they dyspended all theyr vytayle that they had wythin. and so grete hungre became amonge them / that they deyed wenderly thycke within the cyte for hō¦gre. And came vnto Froll & prayed hym to be accorded with kynge. Arthur for to haue peas & they wolde yelde theym vnto hym & the cyte also. ¶Froll sawe y

 worthyest and strongest man of body that ony man wyst in ony londe that tho lyued: and to hym he thought her shamfully haue maryed for to haue had her londe after∣warde / but he was clene dysceyued. For thys Curan was Hauelockis sone that was kynge of. Kyrkelane in. Denmarke: and this. Curan conquered hys wyues londe after warde and slewe kyng Edel that was h

there was a paynem that was called Gormō∣de / that was the kynges sone Daufrices of the panems folke that hadde the reame after hys fader / & was kynge / sauf he bequaue & yaue it to his broder. And sayd that he wolde neuer be kynge / but yf that he myght gete and conque∣re a reame in a straunge countree. For he was bolde & stronge of body. And of hym prophecy¦ed Merlyn & sayde / that hesholde be a wulf of the see. And he lette assemble paynems wyth∣out nombre / & lete appareylle shyppes / & wen∣te by many londes / & toke homages & feautees of many. And so he wente by the see & conque∣red many dyuerse londes. So that he came in to Irlonde / & conquered that lond / that often tymes warred vpon. Brytons / and Brytons vpon them & oft wonne & oft lost & yaue hosta∣ges to Brytons. And so they sent to Gurmon∣de there that he was in Irlonde / that he shold come in to Brytayne and helpe them ayenst y
e
 Brytons / to helpe them to delyuer that londe of them / & they wolde hym holde gladly for the¦yr lord. For he was a paynem / and they were paynems & the Brytons were crystened. well ought he them for to helpe / so as they were all of one lawe. whā Gurmonde herde this pray∣er he hasted him as moche as he myght & arry∣ued in Scotlonde / & came in to Northomber∣londe there that the Saxons were dwellynge and they confermed the couenaūtes bytwene them that were made by othes & by hostages / for to bere hym true fay / & holde hym for lorde and paye to hym truage by the yere ¶Tho be¦gan the. Saxons and y
e
. Affricans to destroye robbe and brenne townes / & destroye all then∣g
 in asmoche as they myght & spared neyther man woman ne chylde lerned ne lewde / But all they slewe / & caste downe townes castels & chirches / & so put they all the londe in grete de¦struccyon. And as soone as they myghte flee / they fledde thens as well poore as ryche / bys∣shops / abbottes / chanons / & all other grete & smal / some in to lytell Brytayne / & some in to Cornewayle / all tho y
e
 shyppes myghht haue.






¶How the kynge. Gurmonde droue kyng Cortyf to Chechestre / & slewe the Brytons / & thrugh crafte & engyne gate the same towne.


COrtyf the kyng fledde thens in to Che∣chestre that tho was stronge / and there helde hym .xx. dayes / & this Gurmonde came and it besyeged. But the cytee was so stronge that he myght not gete it by no maner of wy∣se with engyne that they myght doo. Tho be∣thought they vpon a subtylte for to brenne the towne. They made engynes wyth glewe of nettes / & toke pecys of thunder & of fyre & bon∣de it to sparowes feet & than lete them flee and they anōe flewe & lodged thē in y
e
 towne ther y
t
 theyr nestis were / & in stackes & euesynges of houses / & y
e
 fyre began to kyndle & brente all y
e
 towne / And whan the. Brytons sawe that in euery syde they hyed them out & fought / but a¦none they were slayne and dyscomfyted / And whyle batayll dured the kynge pryuely hydde hym and stale awaye in to walys / & men wyst neuer where he became / and soo was the tow∣ne of Chechestre taken and destroyed. And af∣ter. Gurmonde wente and destroyed townes and cytees that neuer were after made ayen / as it is seen yet in many places of thys londe.






¶How thys londe was called Englonde for the name of Engyst / & how many kynges were made after in thys londe.


SO whan. Gurmonde had destroyed al the londe thrugh out: he yaue the londe to the Saxons: & anone they toke it with good wyll / for the Saxons longe tyme had desyred it. For asmoche as they wereof. Engist{is} kyn∣red that fyrst had all the londe of. Brytayne & lete them be called. Englyssmen: for by cause of Engistes name: & the lond they lete call En¦glonde in theyr langage: & the folke ben called Englyshmen: for asmoche as in thys tyme it was called Engist{is} londe whan he had cōque∣red it of. Vortiger: that spoused hys doughter But fro the tyme y
t
 Brute came fyrst in to En¦glonde: thys londe was called. Brytane: and the folke Brytons. But syth the tyme y
t
 thys Gurmonde conquered it eftsones and yaue it vnto the. Saxons: they anone ryght chaūged the name as before is sayde. And whan thys was done. Gurmonde passed ouer in to Fraū∣ce: & there conquered many londes: & destroy∣ed all cristen peple there that he came. And the Saxons dwelled in this londe and began fast to enhabyte it at ther owne wyll. And they wol¦de haue made newe kyngis & lordes: but they myght neuer assent to haue only oo kynge for to be to them attendaunt / & therfore they ma∣de many kynges in dyuerse shyres: as it was in Engistes tyme. The fyrste kyngdome was Kente: & that othe. Southsexe: and the thyrde


westsex / the fourth Eestsex / & the fyfth Nothū¦berlonde / and y
e
 sixth Estangle that is to saye Northfolke / and Southfolke and the seuenth Mercheryche / and that is the Erldoste of Ny∣choll. Hūtyngdon. Herforde. Gloucetre. wynl¦chestre. wer wyke & Derby / and so departed all Englond in to .vii. partyes. ¶And after that it befell that tho kyng{is} warred oft tymes togy¦der. And euer he that was strongest toke hym that was feblest / and soo it was longe tyme y
t
 they had noo kynge crowned amonge theym / ne no crysten man was tho amonge them / ne crystendome nather. But were paynems tyll that saynt Gregory was pope of: Rome / that had seen childern of the nacyon of Englonde in the cyte of Rome / that were wonder fayre creatures / & had grete wyll and desyre theym to beholde. And axed of y
e
 marchaūtes whens they were / and of what nacyon. And men tol∣de hym that they were of Englonde / and In∣glysshe they were called / but they & all the peo¦ple of Englonde were paynems: and byleued not vpon god. ¶Alas sayde saynt Gregory: well maye they be called Englysshe: for they haue the vysages of angels and therfore well ought they to be crystened. And for this cause saynt Gregory theresente saynt. Austyn in to Englōde & .xl. good mē with hym that were of good lyf & holy men to preche & teche & to com∣uetre the Englysshe people & them to torne to god: & that was in the .vi. yere that saynt Gre∣gory had be pope of Rome / that is to saye / of∣ter thyn carnacyon of our lorde Ihesu Cryste .v.C.lxxxv. yeres as the Cronycle telleth.






¶How saynt Austyn baptysed and con∣uerted kynge Adelbryght and the bysshop¦pes that he made his felowes.


AS saynt Austyn came fyrste in to. En∣glonde / he arryuen in the yle of Tenet and so passed forth & came vnto Caunterbury and there soyourned. And kynge Adelbryght of Kent that was the lygnage of Engist good∣ly receyued saynt Austyn & hys felowes wyth moche honour / and them foūde all that them neded. And more ouer he yaue theym a fayre place / that now is called the abbay of. Shynt Austyn / in whiche place he lyth hym self shry∣ned. ¶This kynge Adelbryght was a good man & wyth good wylle herde saynt Austyns predycacyons / and yaue hym leue to preche thrughout all hys londe before sayd of Kente / to torne and conuerte to hym all y
e
 people that he myght. ¶It befelle soo after thorugh god∣des grace / that in lytell tyme the kynge hym∣self was conuerted to god / and all hys peop of his londe were baptysed. And in the meane whyle the peple torned them to god. ¶Saynt Austyn came to. Rochestre / & there he preched the worde of god. And the paynems therfore hym scorned / and caste vpon hym reygh tayl∣les / so that all his mantell was hanged full of these reygh tayles / and for more dyspyte / they caste vpon hym the guttes of reyghes & other fysshe. wherfore the good man Saynt Austyn was sore anoyed and greued. And prayed to god that all tho chyldern of that cyte that shol¦de be borne after warde / that is for to saye in the of Rochestre / myght haue taylles and soo they hadde And whan the kynger herde of this vengeaunce that was falle thrugh saynt Au∣styns prayer. He lete make an house in the ho∣nour of almyghty god / wherin wymmen shol¦de be delyuered of theyr childern at the bryges ende / In the whiche hous yet wymmen of the cyte ben delyuerde of chylde. ¶whan that sa∣ynt Gregory hadde hrede tell how the Englys¦she people were torned to god & comuerted he sente vnto saynt. Austyn his pallyon by a b
s∣shop / that was called Paulin and made hym Prymate & Archebysshop of Englonde And sente worde that he sholde ordeyne & make dys¦posynge the londe. And anone Austyn had the pallyon of the dygnyte of the Archebysshyp. He made two bysshops of his felowes that ca∣me with hym fro Rome & one was called Mel∣lite & he dwelled at London & that other was called Iustin that helde the dygnyte at. Roche¦stre. And this bysshop Mellite tho went to pre¦che in to Estsex and erystened the kynge of the countree that was called Sicwith that was kynge Adlebrytes cosyn hys systers sone. ¶Thys Iustyn wente to preche in Southse
 and torned moche of the people to god. And Saynt Austyn hymselfe preched thorugh out Englonde.






¶How saynt Austyn wente in to waels there the Brytons were / & how they wolde not beo¦bedyent tothe. Archebysshop of Caūterbury.


SO whan all Englonde was crystened and torned to god / saynt Astuyn went in to that londe there that the Brytons were for to kepe them frome Englysshmen / that is▪


to saye in to ways. And there he founde mon∣kes & abbayes and .vii. bysshops. For y
e
 Bry∣tons alwaye destroyed the crysten people that saynt Austyn had conuerted. And he sayde to the bysshops that he was a Legate of Rome & Prymate of all. Englonde / & that they sholde by all reason to hym be obedyenc & they sayde they nolde / but to the. Archebysshop of Carly∣on they wolde. They wolde neuer for noo ma¦ner thynge be obedyent to the Englysshe men For the Englysshemen they sayde ben our ad∣uersaryes & our enmyes & haue dryuen vs out of our countree / & weben crysten men & euer haue be. And the Englysshemen haue euer be paynems / but now of late that they ben con∣uerted. ¶Saynt Austyn of them myght haue none answere otherwyse / but sayd pertly that they wolde neuer them meke to hym / ne to the pope of Rome. And saynt Austyn torned ayen tho to kynge Adelbryght y
t
 was kynge of Kent and tolde hym that hys folke wolde not be to no man obedyent / but to the. Archebysshop of Carlyon. And whan the kynge herde thys / he was sore anoyed & sayd that he wolde them de¦stroye / and sent to Elfryde kynge of Northun∣berlonde that was hys frende / that he sholde come to hym with al the power that he myght and that he wolde mete hym at Leycetre / and fro thens they wolde go in to walys / and the∣re destroye the Archebysshop of Carlyon / and all tho that had refused saynt Austyn






¶How kynge Adelbryght and the kynge Elfryde slewe Brecinall that was a kynge of Brytons that helde the countree of Leycetre.


IT be tell soo that there was a kynge of Brytons that helde the countree of Ley¦cetre and alle the countree aboute / hys name was Brecinall. And this Bryton herde telle that tho two Englysshe kynges wolde mete there at Leycetre for to goo in to walys. He le∣te ordeyne all the power that he had for to goo fyght with these two kynges / but lytel it auay¦led hym / for his folke that he had were slayne and hymself fledde / & loste his londes for euer more. ¶And these two kynges Adelbryght & Elfryde dwelled a whyle at Leycetre / and de∣parted the londe amonge them / and tooke ho∣mag{is} and feautees of the folke of the countree And after they wente to warde walys and thot of walys herd telle of thes comfyture that Bre¦ic
all had at Leycetre / and were wonder for adrad of tho two kynge{is}. And tooke and those amonge them good men and hooly of hemytes monkes and preestes / & of other people grete plentye that wente bare foote and wulwarde for ta haue mercy of thes two kynges / but tho kynges were so sterne & so wyked y
t
 they wold neuer speke to thē but them slewe euerychone Alas for sorowe / for they ne spared them noo∣more than the wulfe dothe the shepe / but smot of theyr heedes euerychone / & so they were all martrd that to them came / that is to vnder∣stande .v.C. & .xl. After they wente fro thens to Bangor for to slee all those that ther myghte there fynde of the Brytons. And whan y
e
 Bry¦touns herde that / they assembled and ordened all ther power for to fyght with thyem. Two was there a baron in walys that was called. Bledrik of Cornewayle that some tyme was lorde of Deuenshyre but the kynge. ¶Adel∣bright had dreuen hym out in to walys and af¦ter there he yaue them batayll. And at that ba¦tayll was kynge Adelbright slayne and Efry∣desore woūded & forsoke the felde / & the moost partye of his people slayne. And Elfryde flede in to Northumberlonde that was his owne lō¦de· ¶And after that the people of Leycetre shy¦re made with strenght Cadewan y
t
 was Bry∣cinals sone kynge of Leceytre / And he after∣regned nobly and with grete honour.






¶How Cade wan kynge of Leycetre & El∣fryde kynge of Northumberlonde were fren∣des / & of the debate y
t
 after was bytwene Ed∣wyn & Cad walyn that were both theyr sones


ANd after that thys bataylle was done y
t
 Brytons assembled them and wente thens and came to Leycetre / and made there Caudewan that was Brecinals sone kynge of Leycetre and of all the countree. Aed he toke homages & feautes of all the folke of the coun∣tree. And after that he assembled a grete hoste and sayde he wolde goo in to Northumberlon∣de / to destroy kynge Elfryde and sle hym yf he myght. And whan he was come thether / fren∣des wente so bytwene them that they accorde them in this manere / that Elfryde sholde hol∣de all the londe fro Northumberlonde to Scot¦londe. And Cadewan sholde haue all the lon∣de a thys syde Humbre to the Southe / and af∣ter they were good frendes all theyr lyf / and lo¦ued as they had ben brethern. ¶And thys El¦ryde had a sone called Edwyn that helde all



the londe of Northūberlonde after his fathers dethe as his fader hadde holde all his lyf tyme ¶And Cadewā had another sone called Cad¦walyn that helde his faders londe as he it hel∣de whyle he was alyue / and these loued as bre∣theren. And y
e
 loue lasted betwyxt them but on¦ly two yere / & after began debat betwyxt them throughe a synple enuyous cosyn of Cadwa∣lins. called Bryens / so y
t
 they assembled a gre∣te hoste in bothe partyes. And at the laste it be fell y
e
 Cadwalin was dyscūforted / & Edwen hym pursued & droue hym fro place to place so at the last he fledde in to Irelonde. And y
e
 other destroyd & pylled his londe / and cast downe ca¦stels & brente his maners / & departed all Cad∣walins londe amonge his frendes. And longe tyme after came Cadwalen ayen fro Irlonde with a stronge pour / and in playne batayll sle∣we Edwyn & all his frendes / & namely tho y

¶How kynge Oswallde was slayne thoughe kynge Cadwalin and Peanda / and howe Os¦wy that was saynte Oswaldes broder regned after hym and slewe Peanda.


AS Edwyn was slayne. Offris his so∣ne vndertoke that warre ayenste Cad∣walin his came / so y

This sa¦me cadwalyn warred vpon hym & droue hym to warde Scotlond. And whan Cadwalin sa¦we that he wolde not abyde. Cadwalin wolde no lenger hym pursue / but toke some of his fol¦ke to Peanda his broder in lawe & prayed hym to pursue after Oswalde / tyl that he were takē & slayne / and Cadwalin toruned home ayen. ¶whan Oswalde herde these tydynges that Cadwalin tourned home ayen / he wolde no lē¦ger flee / but abode Peanda & yaue hym bata∣yll / and Peanda was dyscomfort

But he had men of his kynne worthy ynough that wolde haue departed the londe / and they warred togyed well. And for asmoche as they were not stronge ynoughe / they came to Pean¦da and prayed hym of helpe & socour. And be∣hyght hym of y

And Oswy was a meke man / & moche loued peas & charyte and prayed Peanda of loue & peas and profe

And to gyder they smote egerly but Pean¦da was anone dyscomforted and slayne. And this was After the Incarnacyon of oure lorde Ihesu Cryste .v.C.lv. yere And this Oswy reg¦ned .xxviii. yere And a kynge that was called Oswyne / that was Peandaes cosyn warred vpon hym and togyder fought / But Oswy hadde the victory of Oswyne. And Oswyn was dyscomforted and slalyne / and lyeth at Tynnemouth.






¶How kynge Cadwaldre that was Cad∣walins sone regned after his fader / and was the laste kynge of Brytons.


AFter the deth of Cadwelin regned hys sone Cudwaldre well and nobly. And his moder was y
e
 syster of Peanda. And whan he had regned .xii. yere / he felle in to a grete sy∣kenesse / & thenne was there a greate dyscorde bytwene the lordes of the londe / that euery of them warred vpon other. And yet in that ty∣me there fell so grete derth & scarsyte of corn & other viteylles in this londe / that a man my∣ghte

t
 he sholde not fynde to bye for golde ne syluer brede / wyne ne none other vitayle where wich a man myght lyue. But onely the people lyued by rotis of herbes / for other lyuynge had they none / so moche was it faylled all aboute / Fys∣shes / wylde bestes / & all other thynge soo that yet to this mysauenture / there felle soo greate mortalyte and pestelens amonge the people by the corrupcyon of the ayre that y

 lyuynge peo¦ple suffysed not to burye the deed bodyes. For they deyed soo sodenly / bothe grete and smalle lorde & seruaunt / in etynge goynge & spekynge they fell downe and deyed / so that neuer was herde of more sodeyne deth amonge the people For he that wente for to burye the deed body / with the same deed body was buryed. And soo they that myght flee fledde & forsoke theyr lon∣des and houhes / as welle for the grete hungre derth & scarsyte of corne & other vitayll / as for the grete mortalyte & pestylence in the londe / & wente into other londes for to saue theyr lyues and lefte the londe all deserte & wast / so y

¶How Cadwaldre wente out of this londe in to lytell Brytayne.


CAdwaldre sawe grete hungre mortaly∣te & pestylence / and the londe all poore / & faylynge cornes ād other vytaylles / and his folke perysshed / & sawe also the mooste partye of his londe all wasted & voyde of people. He apparelled hym and his folke that were lefte alyue / and passede ouer in to lytell Brytayne with a lytell nauy vnto kynge Alayne that he moche loued / that was his cosyn and that his fader hadde moche loued in his tyme. And as they sayled in the see / he made moche lamen∣tacyon / and so dyde alle tho that were with hym and sayde. (Dedisti nos domine tanquan
 oues escarū. et in gentibus dispersisti nos)


ANd thenne began Cadwaldre to com¦playne hym to his folke pyteously and sayd· Alas sayd he / to vs wretches & caytyues is sorowe for our grete synnys / the whiche we wolde not amende vs whyle we had space / & now repentaunce is comen vpon vs throughe my sauenture / whiche chaced vs out of oure reame and propre soyle. And out of the whiche somtyme Romayns. Becottes.

And therfore hath shewed to vs wrathe / and woll chastyse vs of our mysdedes.

Now seweth to you Brytayne all deserte the whiche your power myght neuer make de∣serte / ne yet oure power hathe not put vs now in exyle But onely the power of the kynge all∣myghty whom we haue often offended by our folyes / the whiche we wolde not leue vntyll he chastyced vs by dyuyne power ¶Amonge the worldes & lamentacyon that the kynge Cad∣whldre made to his folke / they arryued ī lytell Brytayne / and came to kynge Alayne before sayd ¶And the kynge receyued hym with gre¦te Ioye / and made hym to be seruede wonder nobly. And there abode they longe tyme after ¶The Englesshe people that were left a lyue and were escaped the grete hungre and morta¦lyte / lyued in the best wyse that they myght. And moche people sprange and came of them ¶And they sente in to Saxonye where that they were borne to ther frendes for men / wye∣men / and chyldren / to restore the cytees with people and the townes that were all voyde of people / and for to laboure / traueyll and tylthe the erthe. ¶whan the Saxons herde these ty∣dynges / they came in to y
e
 londe wonder thye∣ke in grete companyes / and herborowed ther∣selfe in the countree all aboute where that they wolde / for they founde no man them for to let∣e ne withstonde. And so they waxed & multe∣plyed gretely. And vsed the maners and custo¦mes of the countree wherof they were come. And they vsed also the lawes and the langa∣ges


and speche of theyr owne londe that they came fro. And also they chaunged all the na∣mes of Cytyes / twones / castelles / & brought / & yaue them names and called as they nowe ben called And they helde the Counrees. Barona∣ges & lordeshyps in manere as the Brytons be¦fore tyme had compassed them / And amonge other grete companyes that came frome Ger∣mayne in to this londe / came the noble quene that was called Se
burga with men & wym∣men without nombre· And arrayed in the coū¦tree of Northumberlonde / and tooke the londe frome Ilbion vnto Cornewaylle for her & for her folke. For there was none that myght thē lette / for alle was desolace & voyde of people / but it were a fewe poore Brytons that were lefte on mountayns & woddes vntyll that ty∣me. ¶And fro that tyme forthe loste the Bry¦tons this reame for all theyr dayes. And the Englysshe people begane to regne / and depar∣ted the lōde bytwene them. And they made ma¦ny kynges aboute by dyuerse partyes of the londe as here ben dyuyded. The fyrst of weste¦sexe / The second

 Cad∣waldre was passed out of this londe / & dwelled in lytell Bryten with kynge Alayne his cosyn and true frende. And whan he had longe dwel¦lede there / and had knowynge that the morta∣lyte and pestelence was ouerpassed / & that the londe was replenysshed / ayen wyth people / he thought to torne ayen in to his londe And pray¦ed kynge Alayne his cosyn of socour & helpe y

And prayed god allmyghty deuoutly that he wolde make to hym demon∣stracyon / yf his prayer to this londe were too hyme plesaunt or none / for ayenste the wyll of god allmyghty he wolde no thynge do. ¶whā he had thus deuoutly made his prayer / avoys fro heuen to hym sayd. And hadde hym leue y

But the lady wyst not wherfore he it dyde / tyll that he had done alle hys wyll. And whan he hadde done this dede / He torned agayne to yorke. And the lady he lefte there sore wepyn∣ge for the dede that the kynge to her had done. ¶And whan he

And lete sende for the grettest lordes of the londe / and to them made hes complaynte of the despyte / that the kynge to hym hadde done and sayde / he wolde be auenged how euer yt were. And all hys fren¦des counseylled hym that he sholde goo vnto yorke there that the kynge was hym to defye. And Buerne toke his mayne and came to the kynge. whan the kynge hym sawe / he called hym curtously Buerne by name. And Buer∣ne hym answerred to hym sayde. Syre I you defye / and yelde vp feautes homages and lon¦des / and as moche as I haue holden of you / & fro this tyme for warde I wyll neuer of the no¦thynge holde.

¶How the Danys tooke yorke / and slewe the kynge Osbrygt / and soone after slewe kynge Eelle.





Sall was redy y

 two bre¦thern toke leue ofthe kyn¦ge Godren. and wente to∣warde the see for to passe
 o¦uer in to Inglonde as fast as they myght spede Now is Buerne so welle comfor∣ted and faste hyed hym wyth the Danys that they ben arryued in the North coūtre & comen thrugh out Holdernes / and destroyed all the countree and brenned townes / & robbed folke / and sle∣we all that they myght take tyll that they came vnto yorke. And whan kyng Osbryght sawe them come / He tooke alle hys people that he had with hym & came out of the cytee & faught with them / but noo foyson he ne hadde ayenst them / and moche of the people that there was were slayne on bothe partyas. And kynge Os¦bryght hym self there was slayne / and the cyte anene was take and the Danys wente in. ¶And there was also an other kynge in Nor∣thumberlonde / that Buernes frendes hadde those & helde hym for kynge / a man that was called Elle / for as moche as they wolde not to kynge Osbryght be attendan̄t / for the despyte that he had done vnto Buerne theyr cosyn. ¶It befell thus that the kyng Elle was gone in to the wood hym for to dyosporte & of the ve¦nyson some he had taken. And as he sate in the wood at meete / to a knyght he sayde. we ha
 wel spedde and moche venyson taken. ¶And with that worde came in a man & to hym sayd yf yeso moche of venyson haue wonne / an ho¦dred tymes so moche more ther ayenst haue ye loste. For all thys coūtree the Danys haue go∣ten / and taken the Cytee of yorke / and ayenst you shall it holde / that neuer ye shalcome ther¦in / and for soo moche they haue slayne kynge Osbryght. whan kynge Elle herde these wor¦des / he lete assemble all the folke of he coūtree and ordeyned all the power that he myght ha∣ue and wolde haue goten the towne of yorke with strength. But the Danys came out ano∣ne & yaue hym a strōge batayll. And selwe the kyng Elle & the moost parte of y

 he had brought with hym. ¶And the same place the∣re they were slayne / shalle euer more be called Elle crofte / and that place is a lytell from yor¦ke. ¶And the rested the Danys neuer tyl that they hadde conquered all Northumberlonde. And in that countree they made wardeynes / and wente further in to the londe / and tooke Notyngham. And there they abode all y
e
 wyn¦ter / and dyed all the sorowe that they myght ¶And after whan Somer tyme came they re¦meued frome Notyngham and came in to Ni¦choll and Lyndesey / and to Holonde. For noo man myght them wythstande / soo moche po∣wer and strengthe they had






How saynt Edmōde the kynge was Martyred





ANd soo ferre hadde the Danys passed frome / countree to countree. and euer more brynnynge and robbyn∣ge and destroyenge al that they myght tylle they came vnto / Tetstforede. ¶
nd in that coū¦tree they founde a Crysten kyn¦ge / that moche loued god and hys werkes that was called Edmonde. And he was a kynge of Norfolke and Southfolke ¶Thys saynt Edmonde kynge ordeyned as moche folke as he myghte / and foughte wyth the Danys / but he and his folke were dyscom¦fyted / And the kynge hymselfe dryuen vnto the castell of F
amelynham. And the Danys hym purshewed / & came vnto y
e
 same castell / ¶And whan kynge Edmonde sawe that the castell myghte not them withstande he came ayenste theym / wyth whome the Danys fyr∣ste dyde speke. And anone they a
ed of hym where kynge Edmonde was.


¶How forsothe sayde he whan I was in the castell / there was the hyng / and whan I wen¦te out of the castell he went out also / and whe∣ther he shalle escape or deye / atte goddes wyll muste it all be. ¶whan saynt Edmonde had∣de named god / by that worde wyste they well that it was hym self· And anone Hubba & Hū∣gar toke hym & sayd / that he sholde god forsa∣ke & all crysten lawes / as many other had do∣ne hym before· ¶And saynt Edmonde sayde that he wolde neuer / but rather he wolde suf∣fre dethe for goddes loue and his lawes to.


¶Tho toke they kynge Edmonde and bonde hym vnto a tree / & made theyr archers to sho∣te at hym with arowes / tyll that his body sty
¦ked as fulle of arowes as an orchen is fulle of pryckes. But for all the payne that they hym dyde he wolde neuer god for sake. And in the same payne / and torment he deydd / and beto∣ke


his soule vnto almyghty god. ¶And whan they sawe that he was dede / they smote of his heed. ¶And of this manere as ye haue herde was saynt Edmonde martred.






¶How Hubba and Hungar toke the towne of Redynge


SO whan Saynt Edmonde was mar¦tred. Hungar and Hubba yede thens wyth all the Danys vnto Redynge. & as they wente thyderwarde they brente townes and tyees / & slewe all crysten pele y
t
 woldē opnote forsake hod / & caste downe chyrche & came to Redynge & toke the towne & there helde them tyll that the kynge Edelf of westsex came thy∣ther with all his power for to take the townes Tho came out the Danys for to yeue batayll to Edelf / & at that batayll was slayne an erle of the Danys that was called Sidrak. Vpon the morowe came kynge Eldred and hys bro∣ther Alured wyth a stronge power and a grete hoste. And the kynge Edelf came agayne that had foughten the daye before to that bataylle And the Danys tho cam out for to fyght wyth theym / and the bataylle was wonder stronge For many a man was there slayne & the Da∣nys that daye had the vyctorye / & the kyng El¦dred & hys brother Alared that daye were dys∣comfyted. ¶But the fourth daye after warde the Danys & the Englysshe fought tohyder an other tyme vpon Elkedene / & there was slayne a kynge of Denmarke that was called Rafin and foure erles of grete power. And that daye had the Danys shame / for they were dryuen vnto Engilfelde. ¶And the .xv. day after the Danys & the Englysshe men fought an ather tyme at Rafynge & there were the Englysshe∣men dyscomfyted / & from thens a dane y
t
 was called Roynt wente to redynge with his hoste and destroyed all that he myght take. And kin¦ge Eldred faught wyth hym / but he was woū¦ded sore wherfore he deyed / and he regned but .v. yere / and lyeth at womborn.

THus it befell that all men in kynge Ed¦gars courte then̄e spake & sayd / y
t
 Edel wolde was rychely auaunced / thrugh the for∣sayd maryage of his wyf. And yet they sayd he was auaunced an hondred folde more· For he had spowsed the moost fayrest creature y
t
 euer seen. And y
e
 kyng herde speke so moche of her beaute / y
t
 he thought he wolde haue hym dys∣ceyued / & begyled. And thought pryuely in his herte / that he wolde goo into Deuenshyre / as it were for to hunte for the harte & for y

And whan tyme came that the kynge sholde suppe / and the sonne shone / the kyng asked af¦ter his gossyppe and after hys godsone· And Edelwolde made her to come before the kynge And neuerthelesse yf it other wyse myght ha∣ue be she sholde not haue come in hys syght by hys wyll. ¶The lady welcome

And that other sholde answe¦re / and saye Drynke hayll. And thys dyde the kynge & the lady / and kyste many tymes. And after supper whan tyme was for to go to bed¦de / the kynge wente to bedde / then kynge her∣tely on the

And thryes he went for to solace and to speke wyth that lady the whyles he dwelled there in that countree. ¶And after that the kyng remeued thens / and thought hym how he myghte best delyuer Edelwod fro hys wyf / as he had hym fyrste desceyued. And the kynge anone after .viii. dayes ordeyned a parlyament at salysbu∣ry of all his baronage counseyll to haue. And for to ordeyne how the countree of Northum¦berlonde sholde best he kepte that the Danys came not there / the londe for to destroye. And thys Edelwode came vnto the kyng{is} parlya¦ment. And the kynge sent hym to yorke / for to be keper of that countree. ¶And thus it befel that knewe hym not slewe hym by the waye. ¶And anone as the kynge herde telle that he was deed / he lete sende after the lady E

The kynge be∣gate vpon her a sone that was called Eldred· whan this childe was .vi. yere olde / the kynge his fader deyed. And aboute that tyme he had regned .xvii. yere / & lyeth at Glastenbury.

¶How kynge Edmonde Irensyde tray¦toursly was slayne thorugh a traytour / that was ralled Eldred of Strotton.


ANd after tho regned kynge Irensyde and Knoght the Dane. But thus it be¦fel afterwarde / that in the same yere that they were accorded / and so moche loued to gyder. wherfore a fals traytour hadde enuytee to the loue that was betwixt theym and frendshyp / whoos name was Edrith of Stratton / y
t
 was a grete lord / that was Edmonde Irensydes man / & of hym helde all the londe that he had. And neuertheles he thought his lord to betray & make Knoght kynge of the londe / to the en¦tente rychely to be auaūced / and with hym be well beloued / wherfore he prayed hys lord Ed∣monde Irensyde vppon a daye wyth hym for to ete. And the kynge hym curteysly graunted & to hym came at his prayer And at the mete y
e
 kynge ryally was serued wyth dyuers meete{is} and drynkes. And whan the nyght came y
t
 he sholde go vnto bedde. The kynge toke his ow¦ne meyne & went vnto the chambre there y
t
 he sholde take his nyghtes reste. And as he loked hym about / he sawe a fayre ymyge & well ma∣de / and in semblaūt as it were an Archer with a boowe / & in the boowe a fyne arowe. ¶Kyn¦ge Edmonde wente tho nere for to beholde it better what it myght be. And anon the arowe smote hym thrughe the body & there slewe the kynge· For that engyne was made for to slee his owne lorde traytoursly. ¶And soo whan kynge Edmōde was thus deed and slayne he had regned but .x. yere. And his peple for hym made moche sorowe. And his body they ba

yred ¶And this fals traytour Edrith anone went unto the quene / that was kynge Edmondes wyf / that wyst not of her lordes dethe. Anone he toke frome her tow sones that were fayre & yonge / that her lorde had vpon her goten that one was called Edward / & that other Edwyn And lawe theym with hym to Londen & toke them vnto kynge Knoght / y
t
 he sholde do wyth them what his wyll were. And tolde hym how subtylly he had slayne kyng Edmonde / for by cause & loue of hym / so that kynge Knoght all Englonde in his power hooly myghte haue. ¶O thou fals traytoure / haste thou my true brother that was soo true thus slayne for me / mā I most loued in y

Now by my heed I shall for thy traueyll well rewarde as thou hast deserued / & anone lett hym be take & boun¦de honde & foot in maner of a traytour / & lete cast hym there in to Tamyse / & in thys maner the fals traytour ended his lyf. The kynge to¦ke the two childern and put them unto the ab∣bot of westmestre to warde & to kepe tyll that he wyst was best with them to do.






¶How kynge Knoght sente kynge Ed¦mondes sones both in to Dēmarke to be slayne / and how they were saued.


SO it befell soone after that kynge Kno¦ghte had all the londe in his honde / and


spowsed the quene Emme thorughe consente of his baronage. For she was a fayre woman the whiche was Eldredes wyf and the dukes syster of Normandye / and they lyued togyder with moche loue as reason wolde. The kynge axed vpon a daye counseyll of the quene what was best to do with the sonnes that were Ed∣monde Irensydes. Syre sayd she. they ben the ryght heyres of y
e
 londe / and yf they lyue they wyll do moche sorowe with warre / and ther∣fore lete sende them in to a strange londe a fer¦re to some man that maye them defoyle and de¦stroy. The kynge anone lete calle a dane that was called walgar / and commaunded hym that he sholde lede tho two childern / in Den∣marke / and soo to doo and ordeyne for them / that he sholde neuer here more of theym. Syr sayde this walgar / gladly your commaunde∣ment shall be done & anone tho two chyldern he toke and ladde them in to Denmarke. And for as moche as he sawe that the chyldern we∣re wonder fayr and also meke / he had of them grete pyte & ruthe / & wolde them slee / but ladde them to the kynge of Hungry for to noursshe / for this walgar was well be knowen with the kynge & well beloued. Anone the kynge axed whens the childern were / & walgar tolde hym and sayde / that they were the ryght heyres of Englonde and therfore men wolde destroye them / And therfore syr vnto you they be come mercy & helpe for to seke. And for sothe yf they may lyue / your men they shal become / and of you they shall holde all theyr londe. The kyn∣ge of Hungry receyued them wyth moche ho∣nour / and lete them worthely be kepte. ¶And thus it befell after warde that Edwyne y
e
 yon¦ger brother deyed / & Edwarde y
e
 elder brother lyued / a fayre man & a stronge / & a large of bo¦dy & gentyll / and curteys of condycyons / so y
t
 all men hym loued / And this Edwarde in the Cronycles is called amonge the Englysshmen Edwarde y
e
 outlawe. ¶And whan as he was made knyght / the kynges doughter of Hūgry hym moche loued for hys goodnes & hys fayr∣nes / that she him called her derlyng. The kyn¦ge that was her fader perceyued well the loue that was betwixt them two / and had no hey∣re but only that doughter / and the kyng vow¦che sauf his doughter to no man so well / as he dyde to hym that she loued soo well & he her / & yaue her vnto hym with a good wyll / and Ed¦warde her spowsed with moche honour.

NOw haue we herde of Edmonde Iren∣sydes sones that kynge Knoght wende they had ben slayne as he had commaunded walgar before· And this kynge Knoght hadde in his honde all the reame of Englonde & den¦marke. And after that they wente vnto Nor∣waye that londe for to conquere. But the kyn¦ge of the lond that was called Elat came with his people / & wende his londe to haue well kep¦te & defended / & soo there he faught wyth hym tyll at the laste he was slayne in that batayll. And tho this Knoght toke all the londe in hys honde. And whan he had conquered Norway and taken feaute & homages there / he came a∣yen into Englonde / and helde hym self so gre∣te a lord / that hym thought in all the world hys pere noo man was. And he came soo proude & hauteyne that it was grete wonder. ¶And so it befell vpon a daye as he had herde masse at westmestre / and wolde haue gone in to hys pa¦lays / the wayes of the Tamyse so swyftely a∣yenst hym came that almoost they touched his feet. Tho sayd the kynge with a proude herte I cōmaunde the water to torne ayen / or elles I shall make the \ The wawes for his cōmaun¦demente wolde not spare / but flowed euer in

But for all his cōmaundemēt the water wolde not cesse / but euer wexed mo∣re and more on hygh / so that the kyng was all wete & stode depe in the water. And whan he sawe that he had abyden there to longe / & the water wolde no thynge do his cōmaundemēt tho soone he with drewe hym / and tho stode he vpon a stone and helde his hondes on hyghe & sayde these wordes herynge alle the people. ¶This god that maketh the see thus aryse / is kynge of all kyng{is} / and of all myghtes moost. And I am a catyf and a man deedly / and he maye neuer deye / & all thynge dothe hys com∣maundement / & to hym obedyent. ¶To that god I praye / that he be my warraunt. For I knowlege me a caytyf feble / and of no power And therfore I wyll goo vnto Rome without ony longe lettynge / and my wyckednesse for to punysshe and me to amende. For of god I clayme my londe for to holde / and of none o∣ther. And anon made redy his heyre and hym selfe wente to Rome withoute ony lettynge. And by the waye dyde many almesse dedes / and whan he came to Rome also. And whan he hadde be there / for his synnes doo penaun∣ce / he came ayen in to Englonde / and beca∣me a good man and a holy. And lyued and lef∣te alle manere pryde and stoutenes / lyued an hooly lyfe after / and made two abbayes af sa∣ynt Benet / one in Englonde and an other in Normandye / for as moche as he loued saynte Benet more specyally thanne other sayntes.

His heed & his tayle was lyke an asse / that other parte of his body lyke a bere. And he sayd to this man to whom he apperyd. Be not aferde / for I was a man as ye now be but I apeyre now / for I lyued vnhappely in olde tyme lyke a beest whan I was pope. In this mannes tyme there was grete dyuysyon & sclaūder to y

And at the laste they were accorded. And he to¦ke Corodis doughter to his wyf.






¶Of kynge Harold that leuer had goo on foot than ryde on hors.


THis Knoght of whom we haue spoken of before / hadde two sones by his wyf Emme / & that one was called Hardyknoght / and that other Harold. And he was so lyght of foot that men called hym moost comynly Ha∣rolde Hare foot. And this Harold had no thyn¦ge the condycyons & the maners of kyng 
no∣ghte that was his fader. For he sette but lytell pryce of chyualrye / ne noo curteyse nother worshyp / but only by hys owne wyll And he became soo wycked that he exyled hys moder Emme. And she went out of y
e
 lōde in to Flaū∣dres / & there dwelled with the erle / wherfore af¦ter there was neuer good loue betwixt hym & his broder For his broder hated hym deedly 
 and whan he had regned two yere and lytell more / he deyed and lyeth at westmestre.






¶Of kynge Kariknoght that was Haroldes brother.


AFter this Harold Hare foot / Regned his brother Hardiknoght a noble kny∣ghte and a worthy man / and moche loued chy¦ualry / and all maner of goodnes / And whan thys Hardiknoght had regned a lytell whyle / he lette vncouere hys brother Harold & smote of his heed / that was his brother att westme∣stre / & lete cast the heed in to a gonge / & the bo∣dy in to Tamyse. And after came fysshers & to¦ke the body with theyr nettes by nyght / and ba¦re hym to saynt Clementes chyrche and there hym caryed. And in this maner auenged hym Hardiknoght of hys broder for in none other


maner he myght be auengeb· This kyng Har¦diknoght was so large a yeuer of meete & dryn¦ke / that his tables were sete euery daye thre ty¦mes full ryall meetes & drynkes for his owne meyne / and for all that came vnto / hys courte to be rychely serued of ryall meetes. And thys kynge Hardiknoght sent after Emme his mo¦der / & made her come ayen ī to Englonde / for she was dryuen out of Englonde whyle that Harold Hare f

t
 tho was the grettest lorde of Englonde next the kyng / & moost myght do thrugh oute all Englonde what he wolde hys cōmaūdement / for as moche as he had hys spo¦used doughter of y
e
 good kyng Knoght / that was a Dane / whiche doughter he had by hys fyrste wyfe. ¶And whan this quene was dry¦uen out of Englonde / and come to the Erle of Flaundres / that was called Balde wyne her cosyn / he founde her there all thynge that her neded / vnto the tyme that she went ayen in to Englonde / that the kynge Hardiknoght had sente for her that was her sone and made her come ayen with moche honour. This kynge Hardyknoght whan he had regned fyue yere he deyed and lyeth at westmestre.






¶Of the vylany that the Dany
 dyde to y
e
 Englysshmen. wherfore fro y
e
 tyme after was no Dane made kynge of this londe.


ANd after the deth of this kynge Hardy¦knoght / for as moche as he hadde noo thynge of hys body begoten / The erles & ba∣rons assembled / & made a coūsell / that neuer more after noo man y
e
 was a Dane / though he were neuer so grete a man amonges them / he sholde neuer be kynge of Englonde for the de¦spyte that the Danes hadde done to Englyssh∣men. For euermoore before & yf it were so that the Englysshmen and the Danys hapened for to mete vpon a brydge / the Englysshmen shol¦de not be so hardy to meue ne styre a foot / but stande styll tyll the Dane were passed for the. And more ouer yf y
e
 Englysshmen had not bo∣wed downe theyr heedes to doo reuerence vn¦to the Danys / they sholde haue ben beten & de¦foylled. And suche maner despytes & vylany dyde the Danys to our Englysshmen. wherfo¦re they were dryuen out of y
e
 londe after tyme that kynge Hardyknoght was deed / for they had no lord y
e
 theym myght mayntene. ¶And in this maner auoyded the Danys Englonde that neuer they came ayen. ¶The erles & ba¦rons by theyr comyn assent & by theyr counsel∣les sent unto Normandy for to seke those two brethern Alured & Edwarde y
t
 were dwellyng with the duke Richharde that was theyr came in entente for to crowne Alured the elder bro∣ther / & hym make kynge of Englonde. And of this kynge to make an ende / the erles & barons made theyr othe. But the Erle Godewin of westsex falsely & traytoursly thought to slee the se two brethern anone as they sholde come in to Englonde / in entent / to make hys sone Ha¦rolde kynge the whyche sone he had begote vp on his wyf / the whiche was kynge Knoghtes doughter that was a Dane. And so this Gode¦win pryuely hym wente to South hampton for to mete there the two brethern whan that they sholde come vnto london. ¶And thus it befell the messengers that went in to Norman¦dy / foūde but oonly Alured that was the elder brother For Edwarde hys brother was gone in to hūgry for to speke with his cosyn Edwar¦de the outlawe / y
t
 was Edmonde sone with the Irensyde. The messengers tolde & sayde Alu¦red / how that erles & barons of Englonde sen∣te after hym / & that he boldely sholde come in to Englonde and receyue the reame. For kyn¦ge Hardiknoght was deed and all the Danes dryuen out of the londe.






¶How Godewin the fals traytour to∣ke Alured vppon Gyldesdowne whan that he came from Normandy to be kyn¦ge of Englonde and how he caused hym to be martyred in the yle of Ely.


AS Alured herde these tydynges he thā∣ked god. And in shyppe went with all the hast y
t
 he myght & passed the see / & arryued at Southhampton there Godewin the fals traytour was. And whan this traytour sawe that he was come / he welcomed hym and recey¦ued hym with moche Ioye & sayd / that he wol¦de lede hym to London there y
e
 all the barons of Englonde hym abode to make hym kynge. And so they went on theyr waye to warde Lon¦don / And whan they came on Gyldesdowne tho sayd the traytour Godewin vnto Alured Take kepe aboute you both on the left syde & ryght syde / & of all ye shall be kynge / and of su∣che and hondred more Now forsothe sayd Alu¦red. I behyght you & yf I be kynge. I shall or¦deyne & make suche lawes / wherfore god and

re with hym fro Normandy / and after that take Alured & lede hym in to the yle of ely & after put out hys eyen of his heed & afterwarde brynge hym to y
e
 deth / & so they dy¦de. For they slewe al y
e
 cōpany that there were / y
e
 nōbre of xii. gentylmen that were come with hym fro Normādy / & after toke they Alured & in y
e
 yle of Ely they put out his eyen & rent hys wombe & toke the chyef of his bowels / & put a steke in the groūde / & an ende of y
e
 bowels ther to fastened / & with nedles eylesse of yren they prycked the good chylde / & so made hym to go about y
e
 stake tyll y
t
 al his bowels were drawē out of his body / & so dyed Alured there thrugh treason of the erle Godewin. ¶Whan the lor¦des of Englond had herde & wyst how Alured that shold haue be theyr kyng was put to deth thrugh the fals traytour Godewin they were wonder wroth. And swore bytwene god & thē that he sholde deye a more wors deth / than dy¦de Edrith of Strattō / y

 had betrayed his lord Edmonde Irensyde / & they wolde haue pute hym to deth / but y
e
 theyf traytour fledde thens in to Denmark / & there helde hym foure yere and more / and lost all his londe in Englonde.


SIluester the thyrde was pope after Be∣nedictus. ¶Thys Siluester was cho¦se / and Benedictus was expulsyd. And after warde was he expulsyd / and Benedictus was put vp ayen. And after he was put out / and Gregorius was made pope. ¶And he was but a symple lettred man / and therfore he cho¦se an other man for to be consecrate with hym And whan many men were dyspleased wyth thys godynge of two popes / the thyrde was brought in the whyche sholde occupye the pla∣ce of bothe the tow. And so they stroue amon¦ge themself. But Henry the Emperour came thenne to Rome & deposyd them all and made Clement the seconde pope / whom he made a∣none to crowne hym. And he sayde to the Ro∣mayns / they sholde neuer chese pope wythout his assente. And soo fyue beynge popes / sixte was put in. And many men saye / this Grego¦rius was an holy man. ¶Damasius the secō¦de was after Clemente .xx. dayes. This man was an vsurper of the popeheed / and so he dey¦ed sodenly. And anone the Romayns asked to haue a pope / & that the Almayns sholde haue none. For they were so harde herted / that they myhht not enclyne to the entence of the Empe¦rour / the whiche sayd. There sholde be no po∣pe chosen but yf he wolde be of counseyl of the eleccyon. But for all that the put in this holy man Leo / and after he had of that conscyence and refused. And anone he was chosyn by the comyn assent / this Leo put Cryste in the four¦me of a Laser in his owne bedde / and in y
e
 mo∣rowe he founde no thynge there.






¶Of saynt Edwarde the confessour / that was Aluredes brother / & how he was kynge of Englonde.





ANd whan this was done / al the barons of Englonde sente an other tyme in to Normandy / for that Edw
rde sholde come in to Englond with moche honour. And this Edwar¦de in hys chyldehode loued almyghty god & hym drad∣de. And in honeste and clennesse hadde his lyf and hated synne as dethe. And whan he was crowned and anoynted wyth a ryall power forgate not his good maners and condycyons that he fyrste vsed. And forgate not alle good customes for no maner of honour / ne for ry∣ches / ne no manere hyghnes. But euermore and more yaue hym to goodnesse and loued god and hooly chyrche passynge all other ma∣nere thynge. ¶And poore men also be loued / and theym helde as they hadde ben hys owne brethern. And to them ofte he yaue greate al∣messe with full good wyll.






¶Of the fyrste specyall loue that god she

IT befell on a daye / as he went from the chyrche of westmestre. And hadde herde masse of saynt Iohan the Euangelyst / for as moche as he loued saynt Iohn̄ euangelyst mo¦re specially after god and hour lady than he dy¦de ony other saynt. And so there came to hym a pelgryme / & prayed hym for the loue of god and our lady and saynt Iohan the euangelyst some good hym for to yeue. And the kynge pry¦uely toke his rynge of his fynder / that no man perceyued it and yaue it to the pelgryme / and he it receyued and wente thens. ¶This kyn¦ge


Edwarde made all the good lawas of En∣glonde / that yet ben moost vsed and holden. And was so mercyable and so ful of pyte / that noo man myght be more.






¶How the erle Godewyn came ayen in to Englonde & had ayen all his londe / and after¦warde saynt Edwarde weded his doughter.


AS the Erle Godewin that was dwel∣lynge in Denmarke had moche herde of the godnesse of kyng Edwarde / & y
t
 he was so full of mercy & of pyte. He thought y
t
 he wol∣de go ayen in to Englonde / for to seke & to ha∣ue grace of the good kynge Edwarde that soo mercy full was / that he myght haue ayen hys londe in peas. And arayed hym as moche as he myght & put hym to warde the see & came in to Englonde to London there the kynge was that tyme and all the lordes of Englonde / and helde a parlyament. Godewin sente to hym y
t
 were his frendes / and were the moost grettest lordes of the londe / & prayed them to beseche the kynges graet for hym / & that he wolde hys peas & his londe graunte hym. The lordes led¦de hym before the kyng to seke his grade. And anone as the kynge hym sawe / he apeled hym of treason & of the deth of Alured his brother and these wordes vnto hym sayde. Traytour Godewin sayd the kynge I the appele / y
t
 thou hast betrayed & slayn my brother Alured. Cer¦tes syr sayde Godewin. sauynge your grace & your peas and your lordshyp. I hym neuer be¦trayed / ne yet hym slewe· & therfore I put me in rewarde of y

t
 ben my lyeges / erles & barons of the londe that here be assembled / fulle welle ye herde my appele / And the answere also of Godewin / and therfore I woll that ye a war∣de and dooth ryght. The erles & Barones tho gadred them all togyder for to do this a warde by themself / and so they spake dyuersely amū∣ge them. For some sayd / there was neuer aly∣aunce by homage seriment seruyce ne by lord¦shyp bytwene Godewin and Alured / for why¦che thynge they myght hym drawe. And att the laste they deuysyd and demed / That he sholde put hym in y
e
 kynges mercy all togyder. Tho spake y
e
 erle Leuerik of Couentree a good mā to god and to all the worlde / and tolde hys rea¦son in this manere & sayd. The erle Godewin is the best fended man of Englonde after the Kynge / & well it myght not be agayne sayd / y
e
 wythout counsell of Godwin Alured was ne¦uer put to dethe / wherfore I a warde as tow∣chynge my parte / that hymself & hys sone & e∣uery of vs .xii. erles that ben hys frendes goo before the kynge / charged with as moche gol∣de & syluer as we maye bere betwyxt our hon∣des / praynge y

 kyng to forgyue his euyll wyll to the erle Godewin / & receyue hys homage / & his londe yelde ayen. And they accorded vnto that a warde / and came in thys maner as is a∣bouesayd euery of them with holde and syluer as moche as they myght bere bytwene her hon¦des before the kynge / & there sayd the fourme & the maner of they accorde & of theyr a warde The kyng wolde not theym agayne saye / But as moche as they ordeyned / he graunted & con¦fermed And so was y
e
 erle Godewin accorded with the kynge / & so he had ayen all his londe. And afterwarde he bare hym so well & so wyse¦ly / that the kynge loued hym wonder moche / & with hym he was fulle preuy. And within a lytell tyme they loued so moche / that there the kynge spowsed Godewyns doughter / & made her quene. And neuerthelesse though the kyng∣ge had a wyf / yet he lyued euer in chastyce & clē¦nesse of body without ony flesshely dede doyn∣ge with his wyf. And the quene also in her hal∣fe ladde an holy lyf two yere / and deyed. And afterwarde the kyng lyued all hys lyf without ony wyf. ¶The kynge yaue the erledome of Oxenforde to Harolde that was Godewyns sone / and made hym erle. And so well they we∣re beloued / bothe the fader and he / and so pry¦ue with the kyng / both the fader and the sone that they myghte doo by ryght what thynge that they wolde For ayenst ryght wolde he no¦thynge doo for noo maner man / soo good and true he was of conscyence. And therfore oure lorde Ihesu Cryste greate specyall loue vnto hym shewed.

And tho he wyst that he had dethes wonde v∣pon hym / that he myght not be hoole for noo manere of thynge. ¶He cōmaūded anōe shar¦pely all his men for to assoyle the castell. Soo that the castell was taken or he deyed. And soo manly his men dyde y
t
 al y
e
 people that were in the castell were taken / & the kynge dyde wyth them what he wolde. And commaūded his mē that they sholde brynge before▪ hym the man y
t

e
 kyng / the kyng axed hym what was his name. And he sayd my name is Bertham Gurdon wherfore sayd the kynge haste thou me slayne / syth I dyd the neuer none harme. Syr sayd he. Though ye dyde me neuer none harme / ye your self with your owne honde sle∣we my fader & my broder. And therfor I haue quyte now your trauaylle. Tho sayd kyng Ry¦charde. He y

e
 kyng{is} men hym folowed and pryuely hym slewe. And the .vi. daye after the kyng dyde shryue hym / & sore re¦pentaunce hauynge of hys mysdedes / & was houseled and enoynted. ¶Rud this kyng reg∣ned but .ix. yere and .xxx. wekes / and deyed & lyeth besyde his fader at Fontenerad.


HEnyicus y

 whiche he made ayēst mayster Peyrs Lombarde / the maker of the Sentence. This tyme decessyd y

 popes wyll he toke the kyngdom of Apulye frome Frede∣ryk / wherfore the pope cursyd hym. Thenne after the fourth yere of his regne / the prynces of Almayne made Frederyk Emperour / and victoryously he subdued Otto. ¶wyllyam of Parys this tyme began the ordre of the freres Austyn / the whiche ben called (fratres mendi¦cantes) Franciscus an ytalyon a man of gre∣te perfeccyon & an ensample to many a man / dyde many a myracle this tyme. And he ordey¦ned the frere Minors. ¶And the .vi. yere of pope Innocencius the thyrde / the ordre of the frere prechers beganne vnder Domynyke / but it myght not be confermed tylle the fyrste yere Honorius.






¶Of kynge Iohn̄ / that in the fyrste yere of gis regne loste all Normandye.


AS kyng Rycharde was deed / by cause that he had none heyre / nother sone / ne doughter / then̄e his brother Iohn̄ was ma¦de kynge / and crowned at westmestre of Hu∣bert that tho was Archebysshop of Caunter¦bury. And whan he began for to regne / he be∣came so meruaylous a man / and wente ouer in to Normandye / and warred vpō the kynge of Fraunce. And soo longe they warred togy∣der / tyll at the laste kynge Iohan loste all Nor∣mandy & Angoy / wherfore he was sore anoy∣ed / & it was no meruaylle. ¶Tho lete he assē¦ble before hym at London Archebysshops / bys¦shops / abbots / & pryours / Erles & Barons & helde there a grete parlyament & axed there of the Clergye / the tenthe of euery chyrche of En¦glonde / for to conquere and gete ayen Normā¦dy & Angoy y
t
 had lost. They wolde not graunt that thynge / wherfore he was wonder wroth. ¶And in that same tyme deyed Hubert. The pryour & y
e
 couent of Caūterbury chose ayenst the kynges wyll to be Archebysshop Stephen of Langton a good clerke / that dwelled at the courte of Rome / & sent to the pope theyr clery∣on / & the pope confermed it / and sacred him at Viterbi· ¶Whan the kynge wyst these tydyn∣ges / he was wonder wroth / & droue y
e
 pryour and the couente fro Counterbury / and exyled out of Englonde / & commaūded that no letter that come fro Rome / ne commaūdement / shol¦de be receyued ne pleryd in Englonde. Whan these tydynges came to the pope / he sente kyn∣ge Iohan his letter / & prayed hym with good wyll and good hert / that he wolde receyue Ste¦phen y
e
 Archebysshop of Caunterbury to hys chyrche / & suffre y
e
 pryour and hys monkes to come ayen to theyr owne dwellynge. But the kynge wolde not graunte it for no thynge.






¶How kynge Iohn̄ wolde noo thynge do for the popes commaundement. wherfore all Englonde was enterdyted and suspended.


ANd at the last the pope sent by his auc∣toryte / and enioyned to the bysshops of Englonde / that yf the kyng wolde not recey¦ue the pryour of Caunterbury & his monkes / that they shold do general enterditinge thrugh out all Englonde. And graunted full power to foure bysshops to pronounce the enterdytyn∣ge / yf he it warned· The fyrst was bysshoppe


wyllyam of London / & that other bysshop Eu¦stace of Ely / & the thyrde was bysshop Walter of wynchestre / & the fourth was bysshop Gy∣les of Hertforde. ¶And these foure bysshops prayed the kynge / knelynge on theyr knees / & sore werynge / that he wolde do y
e
 popes com∣maundement. And shewed hym y
e
 popes Bul¦les of the entertydynge / but for no prayer that they myght praye he wolde not consente ther∣to. And whan y
e
 bysshops sawe this / they wen∣te fro the kyng. And in the morne after the An¦nunciacion of our lady / they pronounced y
e
 ge¦nerall enterdytynge thrughout all Englonde so that the chyrche doores were shytte with ke∣ys & with other fastynges & with walles. And whan the enterdytynge was pronoūced / then¦ne the kynge began for to wexe all out of mesu¦re / & anone toke in to his honde al y
e
 possessiōs of y
e
 foure bysshops / & of all the clergye thrugh out of all Englond / the lōde he toke / and ordey¦ned men for to kepe it / that the clerk{is} myghte not haue theyr lyuynge. wherfore y
e
 bysshops cursyd all them / that put / or shold medle with holy chyrche goodes / ayenst the wyll of theym that ought theym. ¶And whan the kyng wol¦de not of hys malyce cesse for no maner thyn∣ge. These foure bysshops afore sayd wente o∣uer the see / and came to the bysshop of Caun∣terbury / & tolde hym all thynge. And y
e
 Arche∣bysshop to them sayd / that they shold go ayen to Caunterbury / and he sholde come thyder to theym / or elles he wolde sende vnto theym cer¦tayne persones in hys stede / that sholde do as moche as of he hymself were there. And whan the bysshops herde thys they torned agayne in to Englonde / and came vnto Caunterbury. The tydynges came to the kynge / that the bys∣shops were come againe to Caunterbury / and hymself myght not come thyder that tyme he sente thyder bysshops Erles / & abbotes / for to create with them / that the kynge sholde recey∣ue tharchebysshop Stephen / & the pryour and all the monkes of Caunterbury / that he shold neuer after that tyme no thynge take of hooly chyrche ayenst the wyll of them that oweth y
e
 goodes. And that the kynge sholde make full a¦mendes to them / of whom he had ony goodes taken. And that hooly chyrche sholde haue alle fraunchyse / as ferforth as they hadde in saynt Edward{is} tyme the holy Confessour.






¶How Stphen of Langton came ayen▪ in to Englonde thrugh the popes cōmaū¦dement / and how he wente ayen.


SO whan the fourme of accordemente thus was ordeyned. It was in a payer of endentures / & theyr seales to that one par
e and they y
t
 came in the kynges name put theyr seales to that other parte of y
e
 endentures. And four bysshops aboue sayd toke that one parte of the endentures to them. And that other par¦te of the endentures \ they bare with theym to shewe to the kynge. ¶Whan the kynge sawe the fourme and vnderstode / he helde hym full well apayed of all maner thynges as they had ordened / sauynge as touchynge / restytucyon of the goodes for to make ayen. To that thyn¦ge wolde not accorde / & so he sente worde ayen to the foure bysshops / that they sholde do out and put awaye that one poynt of resty
ucyon. But they answered / that they wolde not doo one worde out. ¶Tho sente the kynge to the Archebysshop by the four bysshops y
t
 he sholde come to Caunterbury for to speke wyth hym there / and sente vnto hym saufcondyte vnder pledges. that is to saye / his Iustyces Gylbert Peyteum. Wyllyam de la Brener 
 and Iohan fitz Hugh / that in theyr conduyte / sauely he sholde come & go ayen at his owne wyll And thus in this maner tharchebysshop Stephen came to Caunterbury. whan the Archebys∣shop was come / the kyng came to Chill
 For he wolde no nyghe Caynterbury at that tyme. But he sente by his Tresorer bysshop of wyn∣cester y
t
 he sholde do out of the endentures the clause of restytucyon / for to make of y
e
 goodes ¶And tharchebysshop made hys othe that he wolde neuer doo out oo worde therof ne yet 
 chaunge of y
t
 the bysshops had spoken & ordey∣ned. And tho the Archebyssop yede ayen to Rome without ony more doyng. ¶Kynge Io¦han was wrother thā euer he was before and lete make a comyn crye thrugh out all Englon¦de / that all tho y
t
 had holy chyrche rentes / and wente ouer the see / y
t
 they sholde come ayen in to Englonde at a certayne daye / or elles they shold lese theyr rentes for euer more. And y
t
 he commaunded to euery Shyref thrugh out all Englonde / that they shold enquyre yf ony bys∣shop abbot or pryour / or ony other Prelate of holy chyrche / fro y
e
 daye afterwarde / receyue ony commaundement that cometh fro the po∣pe. That they sholde take the body / & bryng it


before hym / and that they sholde take in to the kynges hondes all theyr londes of holy chyr∣che / that were yeue to ony man / by the Arche¦bychop or by the pryour of Caūterbury / from the tyme of eleccion of the Archebysshop. And commaunded that alle the woodes that were the Archebysshops sholde be caste downe vn∣to the grounde / and all solde.






¶How kynge Iohn̄ destroyed the ordre of Cesteaux.


ANd in the same yere / the Irysshe men began to warre vpon kynge Iohn / & the kynge ordeyned hym for to go in to Irlon¦de / & lete arere an huge taxe thrughout al Eng¦londe / that is for to saye .xxx. thousande mar∣ke. And thus he sent thrugh out all Englonde vnto mōkes of the ordre of Cisteaux that they shold helpe hym of ·vi. thousande marke of syl¦uer. ¶And they answered and sayd / that they durst no thynge do without theyr chyef abbot yf Cisteaux. wherfore kynge Iohan whan he came ayen from Irlonde / dyde them so moche sorowe & care / that they wyst not wheder to a byde / for he tooke so moche raunson of euery hous / & the somme amoūted to .ix. thousande & .iiii. hondred marke / so that they were clene lost & destroyed / & voyded cheyr houses & theyr londes thrughout all Englonde. And the ab∣bot of wauersaye draded so moche hys mena∣ce / that he forsoke all the abbaye & went thens & pryuely ordeyned hym ouer the see to y
e
 hous of Cisteaux. whan the tydynges came to the pope / that the kynge hath done so moche maly¦ce / then he was to warde the kynge full wroth And sente to Legates vnto the kyng / that one was called Pandulf / & y
e
 other Duraunt / that they sholde warne the kynge in the popes na∣me / that he sholde cesse of his persecucion y
t
 he dyde vnto holy chirche / & amende the wronge & the trespasse / y
t
 he had done to the Archebys∣shop of Caunterbury / & to the pryour & vnto the monkes of Caunterbury / & to all the cler∣gye of Englonde. And that he sholde rest ore al the goodes ayen y
t
 he had taken of them ayenst theyr wyll & elles they sholde curse hym by na¦me / And to do this thynge / and to conferme the pope toke them his letters in bulles paten¦tes. ¶These two Legates came in to englon∣de / & came to the kynge to Northamton / the∣re y
t
 he helde his parlyamente / & full curteysly they hym salewed & sayd. Syr we come fro y
e
 pope of Rome / the peas of the holy chyrche & the londe to amende. And we admonest you fyrst in the popes half / that ye make full resty∣tucyon of the goodes y
t
 ye haue rauysshed & ta∣ken of holy chyrche & of the londe. And that y
 receyue Stephen Archebysshop of Caunterbu¦ry in to his dygnytee / & the pryour of Caunter¦bury / & his mōkes. And that ye yelde ayen vn¦to the Archebysshop alle his londes & rentes / without ony withholdynge. ¶And syr yet mo¦re ouer / y
t
 ye shall make restytucyon / vnto all holy chyrche / wherof they shall holde them wel apayed. Tho answered the kynge as touchyn∣ge the pryour & his monkes of Caunterbury. All that ye haue sayde I wyll do gladly / and all thynge y
t
 ye wyll ordeyne. But as touchynge the Archebysshop. I shall tell you in my herte as it lyeth. That the Archebysshop leue his ar¦chebysshoppryche / & that y
e
 pope then̄e for hym wolde praye / & then̄e vpon auenture / me shol¦de lyke some other bysshopryche to yeue hym in Englond And vppon this condicyon I wyl hym accepte & receyue And neuertheles as Ar¦chebysshop in Englonde yf he abyde / he shall neuer haue so good{is} saufconduyte / but that he shall be take. ¶Tho sayde Pandulf vnto the kynge / Syre holy chyrche was wonte neuer to dyscharge an Archebysshop wythout cause resonable. But euer it hath be wonte to chas¦tyse prynces / y
t
 to god & holy chyrche were In obedyence. ¶What how now sayde the kyng menace ye me. Naye sayde Pandulf / But ye now openly haue tolde / as it standeth in your herte. And to you we wyll tell what is the po∣pes wyll. And thus it standeth / y
t
 he hathe you hooly enterdyted & accursyd / for the wronges that ye haue done to holy chyrche & to the cler∣gye. And for as moche as ye dwelle / & beth in wyll to abyde in malyce & in wretchednesse / & wyll not come out therof / ne to amēde ye shall vnderstande / y
t
 this tyme after warde the sen∣tence is vpon you yeuen and holdeth stede and strength / and vpon all tho that with you hath comuned before this tyme / whether they ben erles / barons / or knyght{is} / or ony other what so euer y

other mē of theyr homages / seruyces and feau¦tres / that they sholde vnto you do / And this ty¦dynge to conferme / we yeue playne power / to the bysshop of wynchestre / and the bysshop of Norwhiche. And the same power we yeue in to Scotlōde to the bisshop of Rochestre and of Salysbury. And in walys we yeue the same power to the bysshop of saynt Dauyd and of Landaf & of saynt Asse. And more ouer we sen¦te thrugh out all Crystendom / that all the bys¦shops beyonde the see / that they do accurse all tho that helpe you / or ony counseyl yeueth you in ony maner nede that ye haue to doo in ony parte of the worlde. And we assoyle them also all / by auctoryte of y
e
 pope / & commaūde them also with you for to fyght / as with hym that is enmye to all holy chyrche. ¶Tho answered y
e
 kynge. what may ye do more to me ¶Tho an¦swered Pandulf. we saye to you in the worde of god / that ye ne no heyr that ye haue / neuer after this daye may be crowned. Tho sayd y
e
 kyne. By hym that is almyghty god / & I had wyst this are that ye came in to my londe / that ye had brought me suche tydynges. I shold ha¦ue made you redy all one yere. ¶Tho answe∣red Pandulf / Full well wende we at our fyrst comynge / that ye wolde haue be obedyent to god & holy chyrche / & haue fulfylled the popes commaūdement / & now we haue shewed vnto you / & pronounced the popes wyll / as we we∣re charged therwith / And as now ye haue say∣de / that yf ye had wyst the cause of our comyn∣ge / that ye wolde haue do vs to ryde all an hole yere. And as well ye myght haue sayd / that ye wolde haue taken an hoole yere of respyte / by the popes leue. ¶But for to suffre what deth ye coude ordeyne / we shall not spare for to tell you hooly all the popes message and his wyll / that we were charged with.






¶How Pandulf delyuered a clerke that had falsyd & counterfetyd the kyng{is} mo∣neye before the kynge hymself.


ANd anone tho commaunded the kyn∣ge the Syrefs & Baylyfs of Northam¦pton / that were in the kynges presence / y
t
 they sholde brynge forth all y
e
 prysoners / that they myght be done to deth before Pandulf / for by cause the kynge wened that they wolde haue gaynsayd theyr dedes / for cause of the deth all thynge that they hadde spoken afore ¶Whan the prysoners were come before the kynge the kynge commaunded some to be hanged / and some to be drawen and some to drawe out the¦yr eyen out of theyr heed. And amonge alle o∣ther / there was a clerke that had falsyd y
e
 kyn¦ges moneye. And the kynge cōmaunded that he shoyde be hanged and drawed· And whan Pandulf herde this commaundemente of the kynge / he sterte hym vp ryght quyckly / & ano∣ne axed a boke and a candell / and wolde haue cursyd the kynge / & all theym that wolde sette vpon y
e
 clerke ony honde. And Pandulf hym self wente for to seke a crosse. And the kynge fo¦lowed hym / & delyuered hym the clerke by the hōde that he sholde doo with hym what he wol¦de. And thus was the clerke delyuered & went thens. ¶And Pandulf and Duraunt his fe¦lowe went fro the kyng / & came agayne to the pope of Rome. And tolde hym that kynge Io¦han wolde not amended be. But euer abode so acrcusyd ¶And neuertheles the pope graū¦ted that yere thorughout alle Englonde that preestes myght synge masse in couenable chyr¦ches / and consecrate our lordes body 
 & gyue it to syke men whiche were lykely to passe out of this worlde. And also that men myght crys∣ten chyldern ouer all the londe. ¶And whan the pope wyst and sawe that the kynge wolde not be vnder the rule of hooly chyrche for noo maner thynge. The pope then̄e sent to the kyn¦ge of Fraūce in remysseon of his synnes / that he sholde take with hym alle the power that he myght / & go in to Englond for to destroye the kynge Iohan ¶Whan these tydyges came to kynge Iohan / thenne was he sore anoyed & sore dradde lest he sholde lese his reame & hym self be done to the deth. ¶Thenne sente he to the pope messengers & sayd. He wolde be Iusti¦fyed / & come to amendemente in all thynges / and wolde make satysfaccyon to all maner of men after the popes ordynaunce. ¶Then̄e sente the pope ayen in to Englonde Pandulf and other messenger / and came to Caunter∣bury to the kynge & there abode· And the .viii. daye of May / the kynge made anothe

 Legate in all maner of thynges in why¦che he was accursyd. And that he sholde make full restytucyon to all mē of holy chyrche & of relygyon / and of the goodes that he had taken of them ayenst theyr wyll And all the grete lor¦des of Englonde swore vpon the boke and by


theyr holydom / that yf y
e
 kynge wolde not hol¦de his othe / they sayd y
e
 they wolde by strength make hym holde it. ¶Thenne put the kymge hym to the courte of Rome / and thenne gaaf he vp the reame of Englonde and of Irlonde for hym and for his heyers for euer more that sholde come after hym / soo that kynge Iohan and his heyers sholde take the two reames of the popes hondes And sholde euery yere paye ferme vnto the courte of Rome a thousande marke of syluer. And tho toke y

And also we may no thynge so worthy of

¶How the clerkes that were outlawed ca∣me agayne & how kyng Iohan was assoylled.


SO whan thys chartre was made and ensealed / the kynge receyued agayne his crowne of Pandulfus honde And sete ano¦ne vnto the Archebysshop Stephen / and to all his other clerkes and lewede men / that he had exyled out of thys londe / that they sholde come


ayen in to Englonde / and haue agayne theyr londes and allo theyr rentes. And that he wol¦de make restytucyon of the goodes that he had taken of theyrs ayenst theyr wyll. ¶The kyn¦ge hymself tho and Pandulf and erles and ba∣rons went unto wynchestre ayenst the Arche¦bysshop Stephen. ¶And whan he was come the kynge wente ayenst hym and fell adowne to his feet / and thus to hym sayde. Fayre syre ye be welcome. And I crye you mercy by cau∣se that I haue trespassed ayenst you. ¶The Archebysshop toke hym vp tho in hys armes / and kyssyd hym curteysly oftentymes / and af∣ter ledde hym to y
e
 doore of saynt Swythunes chyrche by the honde / and assoylled hym of the sentence / and hym reconsyled to god & to holy thyrche. And that was on saynt Margaretes daye. And the Archepysshop anone wente for to synge masse. And the kyng offred at the mas∣se a marke of golde. ¶And whan the masse was done / all they wente for to receyue theyr londes / without ony manere gaynsayenge. ¶And that daye they made all myrth & Ioye ynough. But yet was not the enterdytynge re¦leaced / by cause the pope had sette that the en∣terdytynge sholde not be done / tyll the kynge had made full restytucyon of the goodes that he had taken of the holy chyrche. And that hym self sholde do homage to the pope by a certayn Legate / that he sholde sende in to Englonde. ¶And thenne tooke Pandulf his leue of the kynge and the Archebysshop / and went agay¦ne vnto Rome. ¶And the Archebysshop ano¦ne lete come before hym prelates of holy chyr∣che at Redynge / for to treate & counseyll how moche / and what they sholde axe of the kyng / for to make restytucyon of the goodes that he had taken of theym. And they ordeyned & sayd that the kyng sholde yeue to the Archebysshop thre thousande marke for the wronge that the kynge had done vnto hym. And also by procy∣ons to other clerkes .xv. thousande marke. ¶And the same tyme Nycolaus bysshop of Tuscam Cardynall Penytenciarius of Ro∣me came in to Englonde thrugh the popes con¦maundement / the fyfth kalendas of Octobre and came to London / the fyfth Nonas of Oc¦tobre / for by cause that kynge Iohan and alle the kynges that came after hym / sholde euer more holde the reame of Englonde and of Ir∣londe / of god and of the pope / payenge to the pope by yere as it is aboue sayd.






¶How the enterdytynge was vndone in Englōde / and of the debate that was bytwene kynge Iohan and the barons of the reame.


AS kynge Iohan had done his homage to the Legate that shewed hym the po∣pes letter / that he sholde paye to Iulyan & yel∣ne ayen that was kynge Rychardes wyfe the thyrde parte of the londe of Englonde and of Irlonde that he had withholde syth that kyng Rycharde deyed. ¶Whan kynge Iohn̄ herde this / he was wonder wroth. For vtterly y
t
 en¦terdytynge myght not be vndone tyll y
t
 he had made gre
 and restytycyon to the forsayd Iu∣lyan / of that she asked. The Legate went then¦ne agayne to the pope after Crystmasse. And y
e
 kynge sente ouer see to Iulyan that was kyn¦ge Rychardes wyf for to haue a relate of that she axed of hym. ¶And so it befell that Iuly¦an deyed anone after Eester. And in so moche the kynge was quyte of that thynge that the ax¦ed. ¶But thenne at the feest of saynt Iohan that came nexte after / thorugh the popes com∣maundemente / the enterdytynge was fyrst re¦leasyd thrughout alle Englonde 
 daye of Iulii. And .vii. yere was the londe 
¦terdyted. And on the mornynge m
n rough & sayd masse thorugh out all London and so 
¦ter thorugh out all Englonde· ¶And the ne
 yere after there began a grete debate bytwene kynge Iohan and the lordes of Englonde 
or by cause that he wolde not graunte the law
 and holde / the whiche saynt Edwarde had or¦deyn
d / and had ben vsed & holden vnto that tyme that he had them broken. For he wolde holde noo lawe / but dyde all thynge that hym lyked / and dysheryted many men without con¦sente of lordes and perys of y
e
 londe. And wo
 dysheryte the good erle Radulf of Chestre for by cause that he vndertoke hym of hys wyc∣kednesse / & for by cause that he dyde so moche shame and vylany to god and to holy chyrche▪ And also for he helde and haunted hys owne brothers wyfe / and laye also by many wym∣men greate lordes doughters. For he spared no woman that hym lyked for to haue. wher∣fore all the lordes of the londe were wrothe / & toke the cyte of London. To cesse this debate the Archebysshop and lordes of the londe assen¦bled before the feest of saynt Iohn̄ Bap
yst in a medowe besyde the towne of Stanys / that


is called Romney mede. And the kynge made them there a chartre of fraunchyse / suche as they wolde axe / and in suche manere they we∣
e accorded / and that accordement lasted not full longe. For the kynge hymself soone after dyed ayenst the poyntes of the same chartre that he had made. wherfore the moost parte of the lordes of the londe assembled and began to warre vppon hym ayen / and brenned his tow¦nes / & robbed his folke / and dyde all the soro∣we that they myght / & made them as stronge as they myght with all the power they hadde / and thought to dryue hym oute of Englonde / and make Lowys the kyng{is} sone of Fraunce kynge of Englonde. ¶And kyng Iohn̄ sente tho ouer see and ordeyned so moche people of Normans / & of Pycardes / & of Flemynges / soo that the londe myghte not susteyne them / but with moche sorowe. ¶And amonge alle this people 
 there was a man of Normandye that was called Fawkis of Brent / and thys Normā and his company spared nother chir∣ches ne houses of relygyon / but they brente & 
obbed it / and bare a way a
l that they myght take so that the londe was all destroyed / what one syde and other. ¶The barons & lordes of Englonge ordeyned amonge theym the beste spekers and wysest men / and sente them ouer the see to kynge Phylyp of Fraūce / and pray∣ed hym / that he wolde sende Lowys hys sone in to Englonde to be kynge of Englonde / and to receyue the crowne.






¶How Lowys the knges sone of Fraun¦ce came in to Englonde with a stronge po∣wer of people 
 to be kynge of Englonde·


ANone as kynge Phylyp of Fraunce herde these tydynges / he made certay¦ne alyaunce bytwene theym by theyr comune eleccyon / that Lowys kynge Phylyps sone of Fraunce sholde go with theym in to Englon∣de / and dryue out kynge Iohan of the londe. And all that were in presence of Lowes / made vnto hym homage / & became his men. ¶And the Barons of Englonde helde them styll att London / and abode Lowys the kynges sone of Fraunce. And thys was the nexte Sater∣daye before the Ascensyon of our lorde / that Lowys came into Englonde wyth a stronge power. And that tyme kynge Iohn̄ had taken alle the castels of Englonde in to Alyens hon∣des / ¶And tho came Lowwys / and besyeged Rochestre castell / and tooke yt wyth strength. And the thursdaye in wytson weke lete hange all the Alyens that were therin / And y
e
 Thurs¦daye nexte se wynge / he came to London / and there he was receyued with moche honur of the lordes that abode hym there / & all to hym made homage. ¶And after warde on the Te∣wysdaye nexte after the. Trynyte sondaye he toke the castel of Reigate. And on the morowe after the castell of Gilforde / and the Frydaye nexte after the castell of Farneham. And the Mondaye nexte after the cyte of wynchestre to hym was yolde / and the morowe after Saynt Iohans daye the maner of wu
ueseye to hym yelden▪ And the Tewysdaye after the Vtas of saynt Peter and Poule they toke the castell of Odyham. And the mondaye after saynt / Mar¦garetes day / he ordeyned hym to warde Baw¦more / for to syege the castell / and there he dwel¦led .xv. dayes and myghte not gete the castell / and thenne wente he thens and came to Lon∣don and the Toure to hym was yolden.






How y
e
 pope sēte in to Englonde a legate y
t
 was called Swalo & of y
e
 deth of kynge Iohan.


ANd in the same tyme the pope sente in to Englond a Legate / that was called Swalo / and he was preest Cardynall of Ro∣me / for to mayntene kynge Iohans cause / a∣yenst the barons of Englond. But the barons had so huge parte & helpe / thorugh lowys the kynges sone of Fraūce / that kyng Iohn̄ wyst not to 
orne ne go. And so it befell that he wol¦de haue gone to Nycholl· And as he went thy¦der warde / he came by the abbaye of Swynes hede / & there he abode two dayes And as he sa∣te at mete / he axed a monke of y
e
 hous how mo∣che that a loof was wroth that was sette befo∣re hym vpō the table / And the monke sayd 
hat the loof was wroth but an half peny. O sayd the kynge tho. Here is greate chepe of brede. Now sayde he tho / and I may leue ony whyle suche a loof shall be wrothe .xx. shelynges or half a yere be gone. And so whan he sayd this worde / moche he thought / & often he syghed / & toke and ete of the brede / and sayd by god / y
e
 worde that I haue spoken / it shall be sothe· ¶The mōke that stode before the kyng was for this worde full sory in hys herte / & thought rather he wolde hym self suffre deth / & thought yf he myght ordeyne therfore some maner re∣medy. And anone the monke wente vnto hys


abbot and was shryuen of hym / and tolde the abbot all that the kynge had sayd. And prayed hys abbot for to assoyle hym / for he wolde ye¦ue the kynge suche a drynke that all Englond sholde be glad therof and Ioyfull Tho yede the monke in to a gardeine / and foūde a grete tode therin / and toke her vp and put her in a cuppe & prycked the tode thorugh with a broche ma∣ny tymes tyll that the venym came out of eue∣ry syde in the cuppe And tho tooke the cuppe & fyllyed it with good ale / and brought it before the kyng knelynge sayenge. Syr sayd he was∣sayll / for euer the dayes of all your lyf dronke ye of so good a cuppe. ¶Begyne monke sayd the kynge. ¶And the monke dranke a greate draught / and toke the kynge the cuppe / and y
e
 kynge dranke also a greate draught / and sette downe the cuppe. The monke anon ryght wen¦te in to farmere & there deyed anone / on who∣os soule god haue mercy Amen. And fyue mon¦kes synge for his soule specyally / & shall whyle that the abbaye standeth. The kynge rose vp anone full euyll at ease and commaūded to re∣meue the table / and axed after the monke. And men tolde hym that he was deed / for his wom∣be was broken in sondre. ¶Whan y
e
 kyng her¦de this / he cōmaunded for to trusse / but it was for nought / for is bely began to swelle for the drynke y
t
 he had drōke / & within two dayes he deyed on y
e
 morowe after saynt Lukys daye / & had many fayr chyldern of his body begaten / that is to say. Hēry his sone y
t
 was kyng after Iohan his fader / & Rycharde that was Erle of Cornewaylle / and ysabell that was Empresse of Rome / & Elenore that was quene of Scot∣londe. And this kyng Iohan whan he had reg∣ned .xiiii. yere & fyue monethes & fyue dayes / he deyed in the castell of ne werke. And his bo¦dy was buryed at wynchestre.






¶Anno dm̄ .M.CC.

And fyrste he nourys∣shed the chyrche / and afterwarde he dyspoyled it / as a stepmoder· wherfore Honorius cursyd hym / and all tho that were contrary to hys o∣pynyon the pope assoyled. And the same sen¦tence Gregorius the .ix. renewed And this sa∣me man put Henry hys owne sone in to pry¦son / and there murdred hym. wherfore whan thys Emprerour an other season was lyke / by an other sone of his owne he was murdred / in the tyme of Innocentius the fourth. ¶Hono¦rius the thyrde was pope after Innocenci{us} .x. yere / & confermed the ordre of frere Prechers & Mynors· And made certayne Decretalles.






¶Of kynge Henry the thyrde that was crowned at Gloucetree

And there were xi. byssops of Englonde & of walys / and of o∣ther prelates of holy chyrche a grete nombre / and erles & barons / & many knyghtes of Eng¦londe. And all tho that were at that counseyll swore feawte vnto Henry the kyng that was kynge Iohn̄s sone. ¶And anone after the Le¦gate enterdyted walys / for cause that they hel∣de with the barons of Englonde. Also all tho that holpe / or yaue ony counseyll to meue war¦re ayenst the newe kynge Henry he accursyd them. And at the begynnynge he put in the sen¦tence the kyng{is} sone of Fraunce Lowys. And neuertheles the same Lowys wolde not spare for all that. But wente and toke the caastell of Barchamstede / & aleso y

 And from that daye afterwarde / the Barons dyde there so moche harme thrughout all En∣glonde. And pryncypally y

And there was taken Serle erle of wynchestre / and Humfroyde. Boune erle of Hertforde / & Robert the sone of walter / & ma∣ny other that began warre ayenst the kynge / there they were taken & ladde vnto kyng Hen∣ry / that was kynge Iohn̄s sone. ¶And whan the tydynges cam to Lowys of the dyscomfy¦ture / y

And ano∣ne after the kynge sente to the Burgeys of Lō¦don / that they sholde yelde them vnto hym / & the cyte also. And he wolde theym graunte all theyr fraunchyses that euer they were wonte to haue before. And wolde conferme them by his grete newe chartre vnder hys brode scale.


¶And in the same tyme a grete lorde that was called Eustace the monke came oute of Fraunce wyth a grete company of Lordes / & wolde haue come in to Englonde / for to haue holpen Lowys the kynges sone of Fraunce. But Hubert of Brugh / & y

¶How Lowys corned ayen in to Fraunce / & of y

SO whan Lowys herde these rydynges he dradde sore to be deed & lost. And lete or

And after thys kynge Henry & Swalo the Legate & Lo∣wys went to Merton & there was the peas cō¦fermed / & bytwene them ordeyned. And after Lowys wente from thens vnto London & to∣ke his leue & was brought with moche honour vnto the see with the Archebysshop of Caun∣terbury and with other bysshops / & also wyth erles and barons / and so went in to Fraunce. ¶And after warde the kynge & the Archebys∣shop / and also erles & barons assembled them and came to the cyte of London att Myghel∣mas that nexte came tho sewynge and helde there a grete parlament at London / And the∣re were tho reuewed all the fraūchyse y

And the kynge ca∣me thyder with a strong power / and besyeged the castell. And the Archebysshop mayster Ste¦phen of Langton / wyth a fayre company of knyghtes came to the kynge hym for to helpe. And from the Ascensyon of our lord vnto the Assumpcyon of our lady lasted the syege. And tho was the castell wonne & take.

ANd thus it befell that y

¶Of Merlyns prophecyes that we¦re declared of kynge Edwarde. That was kynge Henrys sone.


OF this kyng Edward prophecyce Mer¦lyn / and called hym a dragon the secon¦de of the .vi. kynges that sholde regne in Eng¦londe and sayd / that he sholde be medled with mercy / and also with strenthe and fyernesse. That sholde kepe Englonde frome colde and hete. And that he sholde opene hys mouthe to∣warde walys and that he sholde sette his foot in wyk and that he sholde close with walwes / that sholde doo moche harme to his sede. And he sayde sothe. For the good kynge Edwarde was medled with mercye and with fyernesse / with mercy ayenst his enmyes of walys / and after of Scotlonde with fyernesse / whan he put them to dethe for ther falsnesse / and tray∣tourily as they hadde deserued. And welle ke∣ped he Englond frome colde and heet / sythe he kepte it frome alle manere of enmyes that ranne vppon hym to doo hym ony wronge. ¶And welle he opened his mouthe to warde walys / and made it quake thrughe hydour of hys mouthe / whan he conqueryd it thruoghe dynte of swerde. For the prynce Lewelyn and Dauyd hys brother. Ris and Morgan. were put to dethe thrughe theyr falsnesse and theyr foly / And he sette hys foot in to wyk / and con∣quered Berwyk at the whiche conquest were slayne .xxv. thousande and .vii. hondred / out take suche as were brente in the redde halle. ¶And the walles y
t
 he lete make shall be noy∣ous / vnto his sede. As men shall here after in∣the lyf of syre Edwarde of Carnaruan hys so¦ne. And yet sayd Merlyn that he sholde make ryuers ren in blood & wyth brayne. & y
e
 semyd well in hys warres there as he had y
e
 maystry And yet Merlyn sayd y
t
 ther sholde come a peo¦ple out of y
e
 nortwest durynge the regne of the forsayd dragon y
t
 shold be ladde by an yll grey¦hoūde / y
t
 shold the dragon crowne kynge. that afterward sholde fle ouer y
e
 see for drede of the dragon without comynge ayen. & that was pro¦ued by syr Iohn̄ Baylol y
e
 kynge Edwarde ma¦de to be kynge of Scotlonde. y
e
 falsly aroyse a∣yenst hym▪ & after he fled to his owne londes of Fraūce / & neuer he came ayen in to Scotlond for drede of kyng Edward: And yet sayd Mer¦ly: that peple y
t
 shold lede y
e
 sayd greyhoūd shol¦de be faderles vnto a certayne tyme soth he sa∣yd. For the peple of Scotlonde gretly were dy¦sesyd after syr Iohan baylol was fled. And mer¦lyn sayd the sone shold become in hys tyme as redde as ony blood in tokenynge of grete mor∣talyte of people And that was knowe wel whā the Scottes were slayne. And syth sayd Mer∣lyn / y
e
 same dragon shold nouryshe a Fox. that sholde meue grete werre ayenst hym / y
t
 sholde not in hys tyme be ended / and that semed well by Robert the Brus. that kynge Edwarde nou¦rysshed in hys chambre that sythen stale a way & meued grett werre ayenst hym / whiche wer∣re was not ended in his tyme And yet sayd mer¦lyn that the dragon sholde deye in y
e
 marche of an other londe / & that hys londe sholde be long without a good keper. And that men shold we¦re for his dethe from the yle of Shephey vnto the yle of Mercyll / wherfore alas shall be ther songe amonge the comyn people faderles in the londe wastyd And that prophecie was kno¦we ouer all full well. For the good Kynge Ed∣warde deyed at Burgh vp sandys / that is vp¦on the Marche of Scotlonde the englyssmen were dysc
mferced and sorowed in Northum¦berlonde / For cause that kynge Edwardes so¦ne sete by the Scottes no force. for the ryot of


Peers of Ganaston / wherfore alas was the songe thrugh out all Englond / for defawte of theyr good wardeyne from y
e
 yle of Shephey vnto the yle of Mercyll / the people made mo¦che sorowe for good kynge Edwardes / dethe. ¶For they wende that good kynge Edwarde sholde haue gone in to the holy londe / For that was holy his purpoos. ¶Vpon whoos soule god for his hygh & Inginyte grace haue mercy

And in that

And by the comyn as∣sent they sholde goo to the castell of Dunstan∣brughe / the whiche perteyned to therldome of Lancastre / & y

And therfore I say as touchyng my self that I wyll not go no ferder into the Northe / than to myn owne castell at Poūtfret. ¶And whan syre Roger Clyfford herde this he arose vp anone in wrathe. and drawe his swerde on hye / & swore by god almyghty & by his holy na¦mes / but yf y

 now is in the kynges courte dwellynge wher∣fore I praye you that ye wyll come wyth vs with alle youre power that ye haue ordeyned / & helpe to dystroie the venym of Englond. and y

And vnderston¦de wel / that ye dyd neuer thynge That sorer ye shall you repente. And now go and doo what you good lykyth / & I wyll put me in to the mer¦cy of god. And so went the fals traytour tyraū¦ce a fals forsworne man For thrugh the noble erle Thomas of Lancastre he receyued the ar∣mys of Chyualrye / and thrughe hym he was made a knyght. Tho myghte men se archers drawe them in that one syde and in that other and knyghtes also. And foughte tho togyder wonder sore. And also amonge all other Hum¦froy de Boughon Erle of Herforde a worthy knyght of renoune thrugh out all crystendom stode a fought with his enmyes vppon y

For there was slayne the floure of solace & of comforth / & also of curteysye. ¶And Syr Roger Clyfforde a noble & a worthy knyghte stode euer & fought / and well & worthyly hym defended as a noble baron. But at the last he was sore woundyd in his heed / And syr Wylly¦am of Sullaynde. & syr Roger of Benfeelde were slayne at that batayll. whan syr Andre∣we of Herkela sawe that syr thomas mē of Lā¦castre / lassed & slakyd. anone he and hys com∣pany came vnto the gentyll knyght syr Tho∣mas & layd vnto hym in an hyghe voyce yelde the traytour yelde the.

Alas the shame and dyspyte that the gentyll orde of knyghthode had there at that batayll. And the londe was tho without lawe For holy chyrche had tho nomore creuereence than it had be a burdell hous / And in that ba∣tyall was the fader ayenst the sone 
 and the vn¦cle ayenst the neuewe. For so moche vnkynde¦nesse / was neuer seen before in Englonde / as that tyme amonge folkes of one nacyon. For one kynred had noo more pyte of that other. than an hungry wulf hathe of a shepe / And it


was no wonder. For the grete lordes of Eng∣londe were not alle of one nacyon / But were medlyd with other nacōns / That is for to say some / Brytons / some Saxons / some Danys / some Pehypes / some Frenssemen / some Nor∣mans / some Spanyerdes / some Romayns / some Henaude some Flemynges and other dy¦uers nacyons the whyche nacyons accordyd not to the kynde blood of Englonde. And yf soo grete lordes had be oonly weddyd to En∣glysshe people. Thenne sholde peas haue ben and reste amonge theym without ony enuye.

¶How Thomas of Lancastre was heedyd at Pountfret / and .v. barons hangyd and drawen there


ANd now I shall tell you of the noble er¦le Thomas of Lancastre. wha he was take & brought to yorke / many of the cyte we∣re full glade and vpon hym cryed with an hy¦ght voys O syr traytour ye be welcome. bles∣syd be god for now ye shall haue the rewarde / that longe ye haue deserued. And caste vppon hym many snowe balles / & many other repre∣ues they dyd hym. But the gentyll erle all suf∣fred / & sayd nother o worde nor other. ¶And at the same tyme y

 was not worth an halfe peny. And after that they sette hym vpon a whyte palfroy full vnsemely / & al¦so all bare / wyth an olde brydell. And wyth an horryble noyse they draue hym out of the cas∣tell to warde hys deth / and they cast vpon hym many balles of snowe in dyspyte. And as the traytours lad hym out of the castell tho sayde he these pyteous wordes. And his hondes hel¦de vp on hygh to warde heuen Now the kyng of heuen yeue us mercy for the erthly kyng ha∣the vs forsaken and a frere precher wente with hym out of the castell tyll he came to the place that he endeth his lyfe. vnto whome he shroue hym all hys lyfe.

¶How kynge Edwarde wente into Scot¦londe wyth an hundrde thousande mē of ar¦mys / and myght not spede.


SO whan kynge Edwarde of Englon¦de had brought the floure of cheua

 erldom of wynchestre and vnto syr Andrewe of Herkela the erldome of Cardoyll
 in preiudyce and in harmynge of hys crowne. And kyng Edwarde tho thrugh counsel of the Spensers dysheryted alle them that had be a∣yenst hym in ony quarel with Thomas of L

so they counseylled the kynge moche / that the kyng lete take to hys owne warde all the good¦des of the lordes that were put wrongfully to the deth in to hys owne honde. And aswell they toke the goodes y

 com∣quered Englonde. / And yet thrughe coūsell of them hym semyd y
t
 he hadde not ynough. But made yet euery towne of Englonde for to fyn¦de a man of armys vpon theyr owne costes / for to go & werre vpon the Scottes y

And at that dyscomfyture was take syr Iohan of Brytayne Erle of Rychmonde that helde the countree & the erldome of Lancastre and after he payed an huge raunsonne & was lete goo.

Ane the kynge & that other Spenser went to shyppe / and saylled to warde walys / & toke noo leue of the kynges Stewarde / ne of none of the kyn∣gys housholde / & went ouer in to walys for to arere the walsshmen ayenst dame Isabell the quene & the duke her sone / And the erle of Ken¦te / and syr Iohn̄ Henaude / And he wente and pursued after them / And theyr power encrea¦cyd euery daye / So at the laste the kynge was taken vpon an hyll in walys / and Syr Hugh Spenser the sone in that othersyde of y

t
 he was nygh deed & therfore it was ordeyned. y
t
 he shold haue his Iugement at her forde. & at a place of the toure hys heed was ta∣ke from his body & also fro Robert Baldok y
t
 was a fals pylled clerke & the kynges chaunce∣ler. And men sette vpon theyr heedys chaplet∣tys of sharpe netles / and two squyres blewe in ther eerys / with two grete bugle hornes / vpon the twoo prysoners. that men myght here ther blowen oute wyth hornes more than a myle. & one Symond of Rydynge y

And anone after was syr Hughe Spenser fader hangyd and drawē / & heedyd at Brystow / and after hangyd ayē by the armys with two stronge ropes. & the fourth day after he was hewen all to pecys / & houndes ete hym. And bycause that y

¶How kynge Edwarde was put downe / and his dygnyte take from hym.


ANd anone after as all this was doone. the quene Isabell and Edward her so¦ne and all the grete lordes of Englonde at one assente / sente to kynge Edwarde to the castell of Kenylworth / there as he was in kepyng vn¦der the warde of syr Iohan Hachin. that was the bysshop of Ely. and of syr Iohan of Pereye a baron / for bycause that he shold ordeyne hys parlement at a certayne place in Englond for to redresse & amende the state of y

Lo here my seale / & I gyue to you all my power for to calle and ordeyne a parlement where that ye wyll. ¶And thenne they toke theyr leue of hym & ca¦me ayen to the barons of Englōde / And whan they hadde the kynges Patent of this thynge / they shewed it to the lordes. And tho was ordey¦ned / that parlemente sholde be at westmestre. at the Vtas of saynt Hylary / And all the grete lordes of Englonde lete ordeyned theym there ayenst that tyme that the parlement sholde be And at whiche daye y

And he swore by goddys souie. that he wolde not come there oo fote wherfore it was ordeyned by all the grete lordes of Englonde / that he sholde no lenger be kynge / but be depe∣sed And sayd / that they wolde crowne Edwar¦de his sone / the elder / that was y

And therfore thrughe al y

And tho sayde syr wyllyam Cruscell / I yelde vp nowe vnto you myn homage for me & also for all the knyghtes of Englonde & for all them that hol∣de by seryaūtre. or by ony other thynge of you so that from thys daye after ye shall not be cla∣myd kynge / nother for kyng be holde for a syn¦guler man of all the people. ¶And so they wē¦te thens to London that the lordes of En¦glonde them abode / and syre Edwarde abode in pryson in good kepynge / And thys was on the daye of the Conuersyon of saynt Poule in the .xx. yere of his regne.






¶Of the prophecye of Merlyn declared of kynge Edwarde the sone of kynge Ed¦warde the fyrste.


OF this kyng Edwarde prophecyed mer¦lyn & sayd that there sholde come a gote



t of Carre that sholde haue hornes of syluer & aberde as white as snowe. And a drope shol¦de come out of his nosethrylles / y
t
 sholde beto∣ken moche harme Hungre / & dethe of people & grete losse of his londe / And that in the begyn∣nynge of his reyge sholde be haūted moche le∣chery. And he sayd sothe. alas y

t
 was kyng Edwarde sone was borne att Carnaryuane in walys for sothe he hornes of syluer: & a berde as whyte as snowe whan he was made prynce of walys to moche he yaue hym to ryot. and to foly And so moche Merlyn in hys prohhecye y
t
 there sholde come out of his nose a drope. For in hys tyme was grete hungre amonge the poore people / & strō¦ge deth amonge the ryche / y
t
 deyed in straunge londe wyth moche sorowe / & in were in Soct∣londe. And after he loste Scotlonde & Gascoy¦ne / and whyle that hymselfe was kynge there was moche lechery haūtyd. ¶And also Mer∣lyn tolde and sayd that this gote shold seke the floure of lyf and of deth and he sayd sothe. For he spowsyd Isabell the kyng{is} syster of Fraūce And in his tyme Merlyn sayd / that there shol∣de be made brydges of folke vpon dyches of y
e
 see / and that was well seen at Bannockysbor¦ne in Scotlonde whan he was dyscōfyted the¦re of the Scottes / And Merlyn tolde also that stones sholde fall from castels. and many tow¦nes sholde be made playne. And he sayd sothe / For whan that kynge Edwarde was dyscō¦fyted in Scotlonde & came tho south warde / y
e
 Scottes besegyd the castels / & dyde them mo∣che harme & brent townes in to the herde erth ¶And after ward Merlyn tolde that an Egle sholde come of Corne wayle / that sholde haue feders of golde / y
t
 of pryde shold haue no pere & he shelde dyspyse lordes of blod & after he shol¦de dey throgh a beer at Gauersych & that pro∣phecye was full well knowe & funde sothe For by the egle vnderstonde syr Pers of ganaston that tho was erle of Corne wayle y
t
 was a won¦der proude man that dyspysed y
e
 baronage of Englonde. but after warde he was heeded act Gauersich thrughe the erle of Lancastre and thrugh therle of warwyk. ¶And merlyn tol∣de / that in his tyme it sholde seme that the beer sholde brenne & that batayll sholde be vpon an arme of the see in an felde / arayed lyke a shelde where sholde deye many whyte hedes. And he sayd sothe. For by the brynnynge of the beer yt betokenyd grete drede thrugh kyttyng of swer¦des at that bataylle of Myton / for there came the Scottes in manere of a s
elde / in maner of a wynge and slewe men of relegyon prestes & seculers / wherfore the Scottes callyd that ba¦tayll in dyspyce of the Englyssmen / the whych batayll. And after Merlyn sayde the forsayde beer sholde do the gote moche harme. and that sholde be vpon the south west. & also vpon hys blode / And sayde also / that the gote sholde lese moche deale of his londe. tyll the tyme y

And there they sholde dwelle vnto a certayne tyme. and thenne they sholde come in to Eng∣londe ayen / And tho owles sholde doo moche harme vnto many one. And that they sholde counsell the gote to meue warre ayenst the for¦sayd beer. And the gote and the owles. sholde to an arme of the see at Burton trente / & shol∣de go ouer / & that for drede the beer sholde flee with a swanne in companye to Bury towar∣de the. North. thrugh an vnkynde outpulter / and that the swanne then̄e shall be slayne wyth sorowe / and the beer sholde be slayne ful nyghe his owne nest. that sholde stonde vppon poun∣fret / vpon whom the sonne shall shede his bee∣mes. And many folke hym shalle seke for ver∣tue. And he sayd sothe. For the good erle Tho¦mas of Lancastre was borne in y
e
 Northwest And cosyn to the kynge. & his vncles sone. and by lawe he made the kynge lese moche londe / the whiche he had purchacyd wylfully. tyll at the last the kyng toke therof shame / & hym self slewe with cruelte And after he gate ayen that he had lost / and moche more thrugh folke that he 
ette assēble out of y
e
 Northwest / tha
 made hym to be adradde. And auengyd hym on his barons / thrugh counsell of syr Hugh Spenser the fader / and of syr Hugh the sone that before were outlawed for theyr wyckydnesse· But af¦terwarde they came ayen in to Englonde / syr

t
 the kynge and the Spensers & the erle of Arun¦dell and theyr power mette wyth Thomas of Lancastre 
 Burton vpon trente / and hym there dyscomfyted and syr Vmfroy erle of her forde was in his company. And after fledde y
e
 forsayd Thomas and Humfroy with theyr cō∣pany to burbrugge metinge with syr Andrew of Herkela / that is callyd the vnkynde outpul∣ter / and also syr▪ Symonde warde erle of yor∣ke came and mette with Thomas of Lancas¦tre with an huge power / and thē dyscomfyted & in that scomfyture the erle of Herforde was slayne vpō the brydge cowardly wyth spere in the foundement. and the erle Thomas was ta¦ke & ladde vnto Poūfret. and tho was heedyd besyde his owne castell. But afterwarde ma∣ny hym sought for myracles that god dyde for hym. ¶And in that tyme Merlyn sayd. for so¦rowe and harme shold deye a people of his lon¦de / wherfore many londes shold be vpon hym the more bolder / and he sayd sothe for bycause of his barons that were doone to dethe for saȳt Thomas quarell of Lancastre. peple of many londes became the bolder / for to meue werre v¦pō the kyng / for theyr blood was torned to ma¦ny nacyons. And afterwarde Merlyn tolde & sayd that the forsayd owles sholde doo moche harme vnto the flour of lyf and deth / and they shold brynge her to moche / dysese. So that she sholde go ouer see into Fraunce. for to make pe¦as to the floure delyte. & there sholde abyde tyll a time her sede sholde come and fetche her / and tho they sholde abyde bothe tyll the tyme that they sholde clothe them wyth grace / & tho two owles she sholde seke. And put thē to pyteuous deth. And that prophecy was full well knowe. and was full sothe / for syr Hugh Spenser the fader. and syr Hugh the sone / dyde moche soro¦we & persecucyon vnto y
e
 quene Isabel thrugh theyr procurement to her lorde the kynge / So they ordeyned amonge them. that she was wa¦gys. That is to saye .xx. shelynges in the daye wherfore y
e
 kynge of Fraūce her brother was sore anoyed. and sente into Englonde by his let¦ters vnto kynge Edwarde to come vnto hys parlement to Parys in Fraunce. But kynge Edwarde was sore adradde to come there / for he wende to haue be arestyd tyll y
t
 he had made amendes for the trespase y
e
 syr Hugh Spenser the fader and the sone had done and for y
e
 har∣me that they had done vnto quene Isabell h
 syster / wherfore thrughe hys ordynaunce and consente of the. Spensers. the quene Isabell went ouer see in to Fraunce for to make accor¦de betwene kynge Edwarde and the kynge of Fraunce her brother. And ther dwellyd she in Fraunce tyll Edwarde her Eldest sone came her for to seke / and so they dwellyd there both tyll that alyaunce was made bytwene thē and the gentyll erle of Henaude / that yf they wyth ther vertue myght dystroye and ouercome the venym and the falsnesse of the Spenser / that syr Edwarde sholde spowse dome Phylyp the worshypfull lady / & the erles doughter of He∣naude / wherfore the quene Isabel and Edwar¦de her sone / and syr Edwarde of wodstok the kynges brother of Englonde / and syr Iohn̄ of Henaude / and syr Roger Mortymer of wyg∣more / and syr Thomas Rocelyn and syr Io∣han of Cromwell and syr wyllyam Trussell / and many other of the alyaunce of the gentyll erle Thomas of Lancastre / that were exyled out of Englonde for his quarel / and were dys¦heryted of theyr londes / ordeyned / them a gre∣te power / and arryued at Here with in South folke / And soone after they pursewed y

 Spen¦se
s tyll that they were takē & put pyteuous de∣the as before is sayd. and theyr cōpany also for the grete falsnes y
t
 they dyde to kynge Edwar¦de to his peple. ¶And Merlyn sayd also more that the gote sholde be put in grete distresse and in grete angusshe and in grte sorow he sholde be lede his lyf / and he sayd sothe For after the time that kyng Edwarde was take he was put into warde tyll that the Spensers were put to deth / and also bycause that he wolde not come vnto his parlement at. London as he had or∣deyned and assygned hymselfe vnto hys baro∣nage / and also wolde not gouerne. and rule his people / ne his reame as a kynge sholde doo. Wherfore some of the barons of Englonde ca¦me and yelde vp ther homages vnto hym / for theym & al the other of the reame. in the daye of the cōuersyon of saynt Poule in the yere of his regne .xx. And they put hym out of hys ryaltee for euermore / And euer lyued afterwarde in moche sorowe and anguysshe.

¶How the Englysshmē stoppyd the Scot∣tes in the parke of Stanope and howe they torned ayen into Scotlonde.


THys tyme the Scottes had assembled all theyr power & came into Englonde & slewe & robbyd all y

 they myght take & brent & dystroyed all the North coūtree thrugh out / tyll that they came vnto the parke of S

 scottes wyst not where to go out but only vn¦to ther harmes. And they abode in the parke .xv. dayes / & vytaylles faylled them in euery sy¦de. so that they were gretly peyred of bodyes & syth that Bruce came fyrst into Brytayne vn¦to thys tyme / there was neuer seen so fayre an hoste / what of Englysshmen / & of alyāces & of men of fote / the whyche ordeyned theym for to fyght wyth y

 he was Mar¦shall of Englonde / as to hym perteyned euer after warde. he sent hastely to the erle of Lan∣castre / & to syr Iohn̄ of Henaude / y
t
 they sholde not fyght with the Scottes / in preiudyce and harmynge of hym & his fee / & yf they dyde that they sholde stonde to theyr owne paryll. And the forsayd erle Marshall was all arayed with his batayll. att the reredoos of the erle of Lan¦castre / for to haue fought with hym & with his folke yf he had go to fyght wyth the Scottes / & in thys manere he was deceyued & wyste no thynge of the treason And thus was the kyng pryncypally dysceyued.

 traytours of londe had ben brought to an ende as it was sayd before. ¶Now here you lor∣des how tratoursly kyng Edwarde was dys∣ceyued. & how meruayllously. & boldly the scot∣tes dyde of werre / For Iames douglas wyth two hūdred men of armys rode thrught out all the host of kyng Edwarde / the same nyght the Scottes escaped towarde theyr owne coūtree as is aboue sayd / tyl that they came to y

 kyng{is} pauylyon / & slew there many men in theyr bed¦des / & cryed Naward naward / and nother ty∣me a Douglas a Douglas wherfore the kyng


that was in hys pauylyon & moche other

e
 kynge was not taken / & in gre∣to peryll was tho the reame of Englonde. and that nyghte the mone shone full clere / and bry¦ghte. And for all the kynges men the Scottes scapyd harmeles. ¶And oon the morowe whan the kynge wyste that the Scottes were escapyd in to theyr owne coūtree he was won¦der sory / and fulle hertely wepte wyth hys yon¦ge eyne / and yet wyste he not who hadde hym doone that treason· ¶But that fals treasone was fulle welle I knowen a good whyle after as the storye makyth mencyon. ¶Tho kynge Edward came ayen vnto yorke full sorowfull And hys host departyd / and euery man wente in to his owne countree wyth full heuy chere & mornynge semblaunt / And the Henaudes to∣ke theyr leue and went in to theyr owne coun¦tree. And the kynge for theyr trauayll / hugely rewarde them. ¶And for bycause of that vya¦ge / the kynge had dyspended moche of his tre∣soure and wastyd. And in that tyme were seen two moones in the fyrmament / y
e
 one was cle¦re / & that other was derke▪ / as men myghte see thrugh the worlde. ¶And a grete debate was that same tyme agaynst pope Iohan the .xxii. after saynt Petyr. & the emperour of Almayn tho made hym emperour ayenst y

 popys wyll that tho helde hys see at Auinyon. werfore the emperour made hys crye at Rome & ordeyned a nother pope / y

¶Of the dethe of kynge Edwarde of Carnaryuan.


ANd now go we ayen / to syr Edwarde of Carnaryuan y

t
 after warde were dystroyed thrughe theyr falsnesse as god wolde. ¶And this Edward of Carna∣riuan / was in the castel of Berkelay vnder y

t
 was made newe kyng / that they wolde not vysyte hym. ¶And tho answerde one of hys wardeyns and sayd. My worthy lord dyspleyse you not y
t
 I shal tel¦le you the cause is for it is doon them to vnder¦stonde / that yf my lady youre wyfe came ony thynge nyghe you· that ye wolde her strangle and slee / and also that ye walde doo to my lor∣de your sone in the same wyse. ¶Tho answer¦de he wyth symple there Alas alas am not I in pryson / and all at youre owne wyll / now god yt wote I thought yt neuer / and now I wolde that I were dede / soo wolde god that I were. For thenne were alle my sorowe passyd. ¶It was not longe after that y
e
 kynge thrugh coun¦sell of Roger Mortymer / graūtyd the warde & kepynge of syr Edward his fader vnto syr tho¦mas Toioursy & to the forsayd syr Iohan Ma¦treuers thrugh the kynges letter / & put out ho∣ly the forsayd syr Moryce of the warde of the kynge. And they toke and ladde the kynge vn∣to the castell of Corf. the whiche castell the kyn¦ge hatyd as ony dethe. And they kept hym the¦re tylle it came vnto saynt / Mathewes daye in Septembre in the yere of grace .M.CCC.xxvii. that the forsayde syr Roger Mortymer sent the maner of the deth / how & in what wyse sholde be done to deth. And anone as the for∣sayd Thomas & Iohan had see the letter / & cō∣maundement / they made kynge edwarde Car∣nariuan good there: and good solace / as they myght at that soupere / & nothynge the kynge wyst of the traytory. And whan tyme was for to go to bed the kynge went to his bedde & laye and slepte faste. And as the kynge laye and sle∣pte the trautours fals forsworne ayenst theyr homage and feaute came pryuely into the kyn∣ges chambre / and theyr company wyth them / and layd an huge take vppon his wombe / and wyth men pressyd / and helde faste downe the foure corners of the table on hys body / wher∣wyth the good mane a woke / and was wonder sore adradde to be deed and there slayne / and torned hys body vp tho so downe. Tho tooke the fals traytours / and tynauntes an horne. And put it in to hys foundemente as depe as they myghte / and a spyt of copre brennynge / and putte it thrughe the horne in to hys bodye


and soo they slewe theyr lorde / that noo thynge was perceyued / And after he was enteryd atte Gloucetree.






¶How kynge Edward spowsyd Phylyp y

ANd after Crystmasse tho next sewyn∣ge syr Iohan of henaude brought with hym Phylyp his brothers doughter / y
t
 was er¦le of Henaude hys nece in to Englonde / and the kynge spowsyd her atte yorke. with moche honour. And syr Iohan of Bothum bysshop of Ely / & syr wyllyam of Melton Archebysshop of yorke / sange the masse the Sondaye on the euen of the Conuersyon of saynt Poule / In the yere of grace .M.CCC.xxvii. But bycau∣se that the kyng was but yonge & tender of ae∣ge whan he was crowned full many wornges were doon whyle that his fader lyued / bycause that he trowed / the counserllers that were fals aboute hȳ / that coūsyelled hym to doo other wi¦se thā reason wold wherfore grete harme was do to y
e
 reame & to y
e
 kynge / & all mē dyrected it the kynges dede / & it was not so almyghty god it wote / wherfore it was ordeyned att the kyn∣ges crownynge. that y
e
 kynge for his tender ae¦ge / sholde be gouerned by .xii. of the grettest lor∣des of Englonde / wythout whome no thynge sholde be doon. That is to say tharchebysshop of Caunterbury / tarchebysshop of yorke / the bysshop of wynchestre / and the bysshop of Her¦forde / the erle of Lancastre / therle Marchall / & the erle of kent / that were y
e
 kynges vncles. & the erle of Garenne / syr Thomas wake. Syr Henry Percy. syr Olyuer yngham and Iohan Rous barons / all thyse were sworne truly for to counseyll the kynge. And they shold answer euery yere in parlement / of that that shold be done in the tyme of theyr gouernall / but that ordynaunce was sone vndoon / & that was mo¦che harme to all Englonde / For the kyng & all y
e
 lordes that sholde gouerne hym were gouer∣ned and rulyd after the quene his moder dame Isabell. and by syr Roger Mortymer: and as they wolde all thynge was done / bothe amon∣ge hygh and lowe. And they toke vnto theym castels townes londes / and rent{is} in grete har∣me. And losse to the crowne. and of the estate out of all mesure.






¶Howe the peas was made bytwene the Englysshemē and the Scottes and also of Iustyfyenge of Troylesbaston.


Kynge Edwarde at wytsontyde in the se∣conde yere of this regne thrughe the coū¦seyll of his moder / & syr Roger Mortymer / or∣deyned a parlemēt at Northampton. & at that parlement y
e
 kyng thrughe hys coūsell / & none other of y
e

e
 scottes in this manere. that all y
e
 f
autees & homages. that y
e
 scottes sholde do to the crowne of Englonde / foryaue theym for e¦uermore / by hys chartre ensealed. And ferder more an endenture was made of the Scottes vnto kynge Edwarde / that was kynge Hēries sone / whiche endenture they calle it regman. In y
e
 whyche were conteyned all the homages & feautees / Fyrst of the kyng of Scotlond & of the prelates / erles barons of y
e
 reame of Scot¦londe wyth theyr seales set theron & other char¦tres & remēbraūcis that kynge Edwarde & his barons had of theyr ryght in y
e
 forsayd reame of Scotlonde / it was foryeue ayen holy chyr∣che / & also with the blake crosse of Scotlond y
e
 whiche the good kynge Edwarde cōquered in Scotlōde & brought it out of y
e
 abbay of scone that is a full precyous relyque / & also ferthermo¦re / he relacyd and fully forgaue the londe that the noble barons had before that tȳe in y
e
 ream of Scotlond / by olde conquest. And ferthermo¦re y
t
 thys peas for to be holden & cōtynuelly last the Scottes were bounde vnto y
e
 kynge in xxx. thousande poūde of syluer to be payed wythin thre yere / that is euery yere .x.M. poūde by euē procyons. ¶And ferthermore aboue all this they spake bytwene the partyes aboue sayd. y
e
 Dauyd Drytonautyer that was kynge Rober∣te Brus sone / y
e
 fals tyraunt▪ & fals forsworne ayenst his othe y
t
 arose ayenst hys leyge lord y
e
 noble & good kynge Edward. and falsly made hym kynge of Scotlonde / y
t
 was of aege .v. ye¦re. And so thys cursyd coūseyll Dauid spoused at Berewyk dame Iohn̄ of y
e
 Toure / that was kynge Edwardes syster / as the gestes tellyth vpon Mary Mawdeleyns day. in the yere of grace. M.CCC.xxviii. to greate harme & em∣payrynge of all the kynges blode wherof that gentyll lady came. alas the tyme / For wonder moche y
e
 fayer dāoysell dysperagyd / syth that she was maryed ayenst al the comyns wyl and assent of Englonde. And frome the tyme that Brute had conquered Albyon· & named the lon¦de after his owne name. Brytayne: that now is callyd Englonde after the name of Engyst


And so the reame of Scotlonde was holde of the reame of Englond / & of y
e
 crowne by feau¦te & homgae. For Brute conquered that londe & yaue it to Albanak / y
t
 was his seconde sone / And he callyd y
e
 londe Albayn after hys owne name / soo that hys heyres y
t
 came after hym. shold holde of Brute & of his heyres / y
t
 is to say of the kynges of Brytayn / by feaute & homa∣ge: And frome that tyme vnto thys tyme of kynge Edwarde / the tame of Scotlond was holde of the reame of Englonde by feaute and seruyce / as aboue ys sayd in the Cronycles of Englonde & of Scotlonde & berythe wytnesse more playnely. And accursyd be y
e
 tyme that this parlement was holden at Northampton For there by fals councyll. the kyng was there falsly dysheryted and yet he was with in aege. ¶And yet whan that kyng Edward was put out of hys ryalte of Englonde yet men put not out of the feautes & seruyse Scotlonde. Ne of the fraunchyses dysheryted hym for euer mo∣re. ¶And neuertheles the grete lordes of eng∣londe were ayenst to conferme the peas & the 
rwes abouesayd / sa
f only quene Isabell / y
t
 tho was the kynges moder Edwarde / and the bysshop of Ely / and the lorde Mortimer. But reason and lawe wolde not that a fynalle peas sholde be made bytwene them without the co∣myn assente of Englonde.






¶Of the debate that was bytwene quene Isabell & syr Henry erle of Lancastre & of Ley¦cetre / and of the rydynge of Bedforde.


THen as the for sayde Dauyd had spow∣syd dame Iohan̄e of the toure in y
e
 tow¦ne of Berwyk as before is sayde / The Scot∣tes in dyspyte of y
e
 Englysshmen called dame Iohanne the countesse make peas / for the co∣wardly peas y
t
 tho was ordeyned. But y
e
 kyn∣ges persone bare all the wyte and blame wyth wronge of makynge of the accorde / And alle was done thrugh the quene / & Roger Morty∣mer. And it was not longe after that the quene Isabell ne toke in to her hond{is} all the lordshyp of Pountfret almoste all the londes that were of ony value that apperteyned to the crowne of Englonde / Soo the kynge had not to dys∣pendede / but of hys vses and of hys escheker / For the quene Isabell & the Mortymer hadde grete mayne of the retenewe y
t
 folowed y
e
 kyn∣ges courte euer more & went and toke the kyn∣ges pryces for her peny worthes at good ch
∣pe / wherfore the countre that they came in we¦re / fullsore addrade / and almoost dystroyed of theym. ¶Tho began the comyna
te of Eng∣londe for to haue enuye to Isabell the quene. y
t
 somoche louyd her before whan she came ayen for to pursue y
e
 fals traytours y
e
 Spensers fro Fraunce. And in that same tyme the fals tray¦tour Roberte of Holonde / that bytrayed hys lorde syr Thomas of Lancastre. was tho de∣lyuerde and out of pryson / & was wonder pre∣uy witth the quene Isabell / & also with Roger Mortymer. But that auaylld hym but lytyll For he was taken at Myghelmasse y
t
 tho cam nexte after / as he rode to warde quene Isabell to London / and syr Thomas whyther smote of his heed besydes the towne of saynt Albons And thys syr Thomas dwelled with syr Hen∣ry erle of Lancastre / and he put hym asyde for drede of the quene / For the quene loued hym wonder moche. And prayed vnto the kyng for hym that y
e
 same Thomas might be exyled out of Englonde. And the noble erle syr Henry of Lancastre had often tymes herde the comyn claymore of y
e
 Enghysshmen / of y
e
 dysease that were doon in Englond / & also for dyuers wrō∣ges that were done to the comyn people. of the whyche the kyng bare the blame with wronge For he was but fulle yonge & tender of aege. & thought as a good man / for to do awaye / & sla∣ke the sklaūder of y
e
 kynges persone / yf that he myght in ony manere a wyse / so as the kynge was therof nothynge gylty / wherfore he was inperyll of lyf & lymme· ¶And so he assēbled all his retenuwe & wente & spake with them of the kynges honoure / and also for to amende his estate. And syr Thomas Brotherton erle of Marchall / and syr Edmond wodstok / that were the kynges vncles / and also men of Lon∣don made theyr othe hym fo. to mayntene in y
e
 same quarell. And theyr cause was this / that the kynge sholde holde his house and hys mey∣ne / as a kyng ought for to do / and haue all his ryalt
e· And that the quene Isabell sholde de¦lyuer out of her hondes in to the kynges honde alle manere of lordshyps rentys / townes and castels that apperteyneth vnto the crowne of Englonde as other quenes haue done here be∣fore / and medle with none other thynge. ¶And also that syr Roger Mortymer sholde abyde and dwelle vpon his own
 londes / For


moche people / In so moche that the comyn people were dystroyed and gretely domaged / thoroughe suche wrongfulle takynge. ¶And also the enquere howe and by whome that the kynge was betrayed and falsly dysceyued att Stanhope / and thrughe whose counseyll that the Scottes went awaye by nyght from the kynge / And also how and thrugh whoos coun∣seyll the ordynaūce that were made at the kyn∣ges coronacyon / was put downe. That is to saye / that the kynge for amendement and hel∣pynge of his reame / & in honour of hym sholde be gouerned and rulyd by .xii. of the grettest & wysest lordes of the reame / and wythout them Sholde no thynge be grauntyd ne done / as be¦fore is sayd / whiche couenauntes were malicy¦ously put downe fro the kynge / where many harmes. shamys and repreues haue falle to the kyng & hys reame / and that is to vnderstonde for asmoche as Edwarde kynge of Englonde some tyme / was ordeyned by assent in playne parlement for to be vnder warde & gouernaun¦ce of Henry erle of Lancastre his cosyn / for sal¦uacyon of hys dody he was take out of the cas∣tell of Kenilworth / there that he was in warde. & thrugh colour of quene Isabell / & of the Mor¦tymer without consent of ony parlement they tooke & ladde hym there that neuer after none of his kynred / myght wyth hym speke ne see. & after tratorursly toke & morored hym for who∣se deth arose a sklaūdre thrugh all crystendom whan it was done. And also the tresore y
e
 syre Edwarde of Kernaruian left in many places in Englonde and in walys was wastyd & bor∣ne awaye / wythout the wyll of kynge Edwar¦de his sone / in dystruccyō of hym & of al his fol¦ke. ¶Also thrughe whose counseyll / that y

 kyn¦ge yaue vp the kyngdom of Scotlond / for the whiche reame / the kynges aūcetours had full sore traueiled / and so dyd many a noble mā for theyr ryght / & was delyuered vnto dauyd that was Robert brus sone all y
e
 ryght / y
t
 no ryght had to the reame. as all the world it wyst. And also by whom the chartres & remēbraunces y
t
 they had of the ryght Scotlond were take out of the tresory / taken to the Scottes the kynges enmyes / to dysheritynge of hym and of his suc¦cessours / & to grete harme of hys lyeges / & gre¦te repreef to all Englysshemen for euer more. ¶Also wherfore dame Iohan of the toure the kynges syster Edward / was dysperagyd and maryed vnto Dauyd that was Robertbrus so¦ne. that was a traytour & enmye vnto Englon¦de. & thrugh whoos counseyl she was take into our enmyes hondes out of Englonde. ¶And in this meane whyle. y
e
 good erle Henry of Lā¦castre & hys companie toke counseyl how those poyntes aboue sayd myght be amended to the worshyp of the kynge & to hys profyte & to the profyte of his leyg{is} / and the quene Isabel thru¦ghe coniectynge & also of the Mortymers lete ordeyne a parlement at Salysburye. And at y
e
 same parlement / the Mortymer was made er¦le of Marche ayenst all the barons wyll of En¦glonde in preiudyce of y
e
 kyng & of hys crowne And syr Iohan of Eltham the kynges brother was gyrde with a swerde of Corne waylle. and tho was callyd erle of Corne waylle. & euer mo¦re quene Isabell procuryd so moche ayenst her sone y
e
 kyng / that she had the warde of y

 forsay¦de syr Edward & of his lōdes. And at that par∣lemente the erle of Lancastre wolde not come / But ordeyned all his power ayenst quene Isa¦bel and the Mortymer / And men of London or¦deyned them with fyue hūdred men of armys. ¶Whan quene Isabel wist of the doynge 
 swore by god and by hys names full angerly / that in an euell tyme he thought vppon tho po∣yntes / Tho sente the quene Isabell & the Mor¦tymer after theyr retenwe & after the kyngys retenewe / soo that they had ordeyned amonge them an huge hoste. And they counseylled the kynge / so that vppon a nyght 
 they rode .xxiii. myles to Bedford / there the erle of Lancastre was with his company / and thought to haue hym dystroyed / and that nyght she rode besyde the kynge her sone as a knyght for drede of de∣the. And it was done the kyng to vnderstond / that the erle Henry of Lancastre and hys com¦pany wolde haue dystroyed the kyng and hys counseylle for euer more / wherfore the kynge was somdele to wardes hym heuy and anoye
 ¶Whan the erle Marshall and therle of Ken∣te the kynges brother herde of thys tydynges / they rode soo in message bytwene theym / that the kynge grauntyd hym hys peas to therle Henry of Lancastre / for a certayne raunsom∣me of an leuen thousande pounde / But that was neuer payed afterwarde. And thyse were the lordes that helde with Syr Henry of Lan¦castre. Syr Beaumont / syr Fouk fytz waren syr Thomas Rocelyn / Syr wyllyam Trus∣dr




ynghtes moo that were to hym consen¦ted / and alle those were exyled thrughe coun∣seylle of the quene Isabell and of Mortymer. For y
e
 Mortymer wayted to haue theyr lōdes yf that he myght thrugh ony maner coniectyn¦ge / For he was to coueytous & hadde to moche his wyll and that was grete pyte.






¶How kynge Edwarde went ouer the see for to doo his homage vnto the kynge of Fraū¦ce / for the duchye of Guyhenne.


IT was not longe after that the kyng of Fraunce / thrugh counseyll of hys Don∣zepers / sente to kynge Edwarde of Englode that he sholde come to Parys & do his homage as reason it wolde / for the duchye of Guyon / & so thrughe coūsell of the lordes of Englonde kynge Edwarde went ouer see. And at the As∣cyon tyde / he came vnto Parys / the thyrde ye¦re of his regne / for to do his homage vnto the kyng of fraūce. & the kyng receyued hys homa¦ge / & made of hym moche Ioy & worshyp / but whan kynge Edwarde had done hys homage hastyly he was sent for in to Englonde thrugh the quen Isabell his moder & anone hastyly he came ayen in to Englonde / vpon wytsonday without ony takynge leue of y
e
 kynge of Fraū¦ce. wherfore he was wonder wrothe.






¶How syr Roger Mortymer bare hym proudely and soo hyghe.


ANd now shall ye here of syr roger mor¦tymer of wygmore that desyred and co¦ueted to be at an hygh astate / so that the kyng grauntyd hym to be callyd erle of Marche tho¦rughe out all hys lordshyp. And he became soo proude & hauteyn / y
t
 he wolde lese & forsake the name y
t
 his elders had euer be fore / & for y
e
 cau∣se he let hym calle erle of marche. And none of the comnyns of Englonde durste calle hym by other name / for he was callyd so by y
e
 kyngys crye. that men shold calle hym erle of Marche And mortymer bare hym so hauteyn & so prou¦de that wonder it was for to wyte. & also dys∣guysed hym with wōnder ryche clothes out of al manere of reason / both of shapynge and of werynge. wher of the Englysshmen had grete wonder / how / and in what manere he myght contryue or fynde suche manere pryde. & they s
yd amonge them comynly / y
t
 his pryde shol∣de not longe endure. ¶And the same tyme syr Gyffray Mortymer the yonge / that was mor¦tymers sone. lete calle hym kynge of foly / and so it befell after warde in dede / for he was soo full of pryde and of wretchydnesse / that he hel¦de a rounde table in walys / to all men that the der came / and coūterfeted the doynge and the manere of kyng Arthurs table / but openly he fayled / for the noble kynge Arthur was y
e
 mo¦ost noble lord of renomme / that was in all the worlde in hys tyme & yet came neuer none su∣che after / For all y
e
 noble knyghtes ī all crystē¦dom of dedys of armys assayed / dwellyd wyth kynge Arthur / & helde hym for there lorde and souerayne / And that was well seen / for he con¦quered in a bataylle a Romayne y
t
 was callyd Froll. And gate of hym the reame of Fraunce and slewe hym wyth hys owne hondes / & also he faught with a gyaunt that was callyd Dy∣nabus / & slewe hym that had rauysshed fayre Elayne that was kyng Howels ne
e / kynge of lytyll Brytayn & after he slewe in bataylle the Emperour of rome / y
t
 was callyd Lucye / that hadde assembled ayenst Arthur / for to fyghte wyth hym so moche people of Romayns and Pebytes & sarasyns / that no man cowde nom∣bre them / and he dyscomfyted them alle as the story tellyth ¶And in that same thyme comyn voyce spronge in Englond thrugh coniectyn∣ge and ordynaunce of the frere prechers / that syr Edwarde of Carnariuan / that was kyng Edwardes fader of whome the geste tellyth / sayde that he was alyue in the castell of Corf / wherof all the comyns of Englonde almoost were ī sorowe and drede / whether that it were soo or not / For they wist not how traytoursly Mortymer had hym done murthred.






¶How Edmonde of wodstok that was er¦le of Kente & the kynges brother Edwarde of Carnaryuan / was heedyd at wynchestre.


ANd vppon a tyme it befell soo / that syr Edmonde of wodstok erle of Kent spa∣ke vnto pope Iohan the .xxii. at Auinion / & say¦de that almyghty god had ofte tymes done for Thomas loue of Lancastre many grete myra¦cles to many men and wymmen / y
t
 were thru∣ghe dyuers maladyes vndoone. ¶As vnto the worlde / and thrughe his prayer they were brou¦ghte vnto there helthe. and soo syr Edmonde prayed the pope hertely that he wolde graunt hym grace / the forsayde Thomas myghte be traunslatyd. But the pope sayde naye that he sholde not be traunslatyd / vnto the tyme that he were better certyfyed of the clergye of Eng¦lond


and seen by theyr obedyence what thyn¦ge god had done for the loue of saynt Thomas of Lācastre after the suggestiō that the forsayd erle of Kent hadde vnto hym made And whan this Edmonde saw that he myght not spede of his purpos: as touchynge the traunslacion He prayed hȳ of coūsell. as touchynge syr Edwar¦de of Carnariuan hys brother / & sayd. that not longe agon he was kynge of Englonde / what thynge myghte beste be done as touchynge his delyueraūce / sythe y
t
 a comune fame was thr∣ugh Englonde y
t
 he is alyue. hole & sauf whā y
e
 pope herde hȳ tell y
t
 syr Edwarde was alyue. He cōmaūded y
e
 erle vpō his blyssynge. that he sholde helpe with all the power that he myght / that he were deliuered out of pryson / & saue his body in all manere that he myght. And to bryn¦ge this thynge to an ende he assoyled hym & his cōpany a pena et culpa) & all that to his delyue¦raūce. Tho toke Edmond of wodstok his leue of y
e
 pope & came ayen into Englōde / & whā syr Edmonde was come / some of y
e
 frere prechers came & sayd that syr Edwarde his brother yet was alyue in y
e
 castell of Corf / vnder y
e
 kepyn∣ge of syr Thomas Gurnay. tho sped hȳ the for¦sayd Edmonde as fast as he myght / tyll he ca∣me to y
e

And thus it befel that the forsayd Edmonde prayed specyally to tel hym pryuely of his lorde his brother syr Edward / yf that he lyued or were deed / & yf he were alyue he pray∣ed hym ones to haue a syght of hym. And this syr Iohn̄ Daueryl was a hygh herted mā & ful of courage / & answerde shortly to syr Edmond & sayd / that syr Edwarde hys brother was in helth. & vnder hys kepynge. & durst not shewe hym vnto no man syth it was defended him in the kyngys halfe Edwarde / y
t
 was Edwardes sone of Carnuariuan & also by the cōmaunde∣ment of quene Isabel y
e
 kynges moder / & of syr Roger Mortymer / that he sholde shewe hys bo¦dy to noo mā of the world sauf only to thē vpō lyf & lym̄e & disherytynge of his heyres for euer more. But the fals traytour falsly lyed. For he was not in his warde / but was take thēs and lad to the castell of Berkeley by syr Thomas of gurney by the cōmaūdemente of Mortymer tyll he was dede as before is sayd / But syr Ed¦monde of wodstok wyst no thynge that syr ed∣warde his brother was deed / wherupon he to∣ke a letter vnto kyng Edward his brother as to his worthy lorde & receyued y
e
 letter of hym and behyght hym ryght faythful to do his mes¦sage without fayll. And with that syr Edmon¦de toke leue of the forsayd Iohn̄ / and yede into his owne coūtre & lordshyp in kent that he had there. Anone as this same Iohan wist. that syr Edmonde was gone into Kent his owne lord¦shyp. anone he went in all y
e
 hast that he myght fro the Castell of Corf & came vnto syr Roger Mortymer and toke hym the letter that syr Ed∣mond of wodstok erle of Kent had taken hym closyd and ensealed with his owne seale / And whan syr Roger Mortymer had receyued the letter / he vnclosed it / and sawe that was con∣teyned therin / & began it to rede. wherof the be∣gynnynge was this. ¶Worshyppes and reue¦rence wyth brother alyegaunce & subieccyon / syr knyȝt worshypfull & dere brother 
 yf it you please I praye you hertely that ye be in gode cō¦forthe / for I shall soo ordeyn for you y
t
 ye shall come out of prysō & be delyuered of that dysese that ye ben in / and vnderstondyth of your gre∣te lordshyp / that I haue to myn assentynge all moost all the grete lordes of Englonde wyth all theyr apperyll / that is to say wyth armour with tresour wythout nombre / for to maynte∣ne your quarell so ferforth / that ye shall be kyn¦ge agayn as ye were before / and that they ha∣ue sworne to me vpon a boke / and aswell prela¦tes as erles and barons. ¶Whan syr Roger Mortymer saw & vnderstode / the myght and the strenth of the letter anone his hert for wra∣the began to boll and euyll herte bare to ward syr Edmōde of wodstok that was erle of kent. and wyth all the hast that he myght / he wente vnto dame Isabell the quene / that was y
e
 was the kynges moder / & shewed her syr Edmonds letter / his wyll and his purpose and how that he had coniected & ordeyned to put downe kyn∣ge Edwarde of wyndsore her sone. of his ryal¦te and of his kyngdome / Nowe certes syr Ro∣ger sayd she hathe syr Edmonde done so now by my faders soule sayde she / I wyll be therof auenged / yf that god graunte me lyf / and that in a shorte tyme. And with that quene Isabell wente vnto kynge Edwarde her sone / there he was att the parlemente at wynchestre. to haue


amende the wrongys and the trespasses that were done amonge the people of hys reame / & tho she toke and shewed hym the letter that syr Edmond of wodstok had made / and ensealed with hys owne seale and badde hym vpon her blessynge. that he sholde be auengyd vpon syr edmond as vpon his dedely enmye. Tho was the quene sore wrothe to warde syr Edmonde erle of Kente. And sessyd neuer to praye vntyll her sone / tyll that he had sente in all the hast af¦ter hym. And vpon that the kynge sent by hys letters after syr Edmoode of wodstok / that he sholde come & speke wyth hym att wynchestre all manere thinge left. And whan syr edmond sawe that the kynge sente after hym wyth hys letters ensealed / ye hastyd hym in alle y
t
 he my∣ghte tylle that he came to wynchestre. ¶But whan the quene wyst that syr Edmonde was come to wynchestre tho anone she prayed and so faste wende vnto kynge edwarde her sone / that the good erle was arested anone / and lad¦de vnto the barre before Robert of Hamonde that was Coroner of the kynges housholde. And he assocyed vnto hym syr Roger Morty∣mer. And tho spake the for sayd Roger and say¦de syr edmonde erle of Kent / ye shall vnderstō¦de that it is done vs to wyte / and pryncypally vnto our lyege lorde the kynge edwarde of en¦glonde almyghty god hym saue and kepe / that ye be his deedly enmye / and a traytoure / and also a comune enmye to the reame and that ye haue ben aboute many a day. For to make pry¦ue delyueraunce of syr edwarde somtyme kyn∣ge of englonde your broder / the whiche somty¦me was put downe of hys ryaltee by y
e
 comyn assent of the lordes of englond / in peasynge of our lorde the kynges estate / and also of his rea¦me. ¶Tho answerd the good man and sayd / For soth syr vnderstonde well that I was ne∣uer traytoure to my kynge / ne to the reame / & that I doo me on god / and on all the worlde / & therfore by my kynges leue. I shalle it preue & defende as a man ought for to do. ¶Tho say∣de Mortymer. syr Edmonde. it is so ferfor the knowe that it may not be well gaynsayd / and that in presence of all that here been. it shalle be well prouyd. Now had this fals mortymer the same letter that syr edmonde hadde take to Syr Iohan Daueryll in the castell of Corf for to take to kynge edwarde hys brother that syr Edmonde wyst not of ne supposed no thynge that syr Iohn̄ Daueryll had be so fals to dely∣uer his letter in suche wyse vnto Mortymer. And thought no manere of thynge of that let∣ter. Thenne Mortymer sayd to syr edmonde / and shewed a letter sealed. & axed hym yf that he knewe y
e
 letter and y
e
 seale. This syr edmon¦de lokyd theron / & auysed hym longe tyme on the prynte of the seale / for he myght not see the letter with in. and wyst well that it was his se∣ale / & thought that it had be somme letter that had bore no grete charge / & thought no thinge of that other letter. And sayd openly in heryn∣ge of them all / ye for soth thys is my seale. and I wyll it not for sake. ¶Lo sayde the Morty∣mer / syres ye here al what he hath sayd / & that he knowlegyth hym that this is his letter & hys seale. And now ye shall here what is conteyned therin / & thenne Mortymer openyd the letter that he had folde tofore togyder. & redde it open¦ly worde by worde in herynge of theym all / & whan the letter was redde / he sayd / Loo syres ye haue herde alle y
e
 herin is wrytē / and that he hath knowlegyth that this is his letter & his se¦ale. & he may not go therfro / And thenne they cryed & yaue dome / that he sholde be hangyd & drawen / & hys heed smyten of in a manere of a traytour & he & hys heyres dysheryted for euer more / & so he was ladde forth and put in to pry¦son. and whan this was done. & the quene wist that he was dampned by way of lawe / both of lyf and of lym̄e / & hys heyres dysheryted for e∣uermore. thrugh open knowlegynge in playn∣court / where them thought that it were good / that the forsayd syr Edmond were hastyly slay¦ne / wythout wyttynge of the kyng / or elles the kynge wolde lyghtly foryeue hym hys dethe / & thenne it shode torne theym so moche sorowe / so as he was empechyd / And anone the quene thrugh counseyll of the Mortymer / and wyth out ony other counsell sent in hast to the Bay¦lyfe of wynchestre that they sholde smyte of Syr Edmondes heed Erle of Kente wythout ony manere abydynge or respyte vpon payne of lyf and lymme. And that he sholde haue no¦ne other execusyon / By cause of caryenge not withstandynge the Iugement. Tho toke the Baylyes syr edmonde out of pryson / and lad∣de hym besyde the castell of wynchestre / & the∣re they made a gonfermer smyte of hys heed / for none other durste it doo / and soo he deyed there / alas the whyle. That is to say the tenth


daye of Octobre / the thyrde yere of kynge Ed¦warde regne. ¶And whan the kyng wist ther¦of / he was wonder sory / and lete entyere hym at the frere Mynors at wynchestre.






¶Of the deth of syr Roger Mortymer Erle of Marche.


ANd so it befell at that tyme that syr Ro¦ger Mortymer erle of y
e
 Marche / was so proude and so hauteyne that he helde no lor∣de of the reame his pere. And tho became he so coueytous / that he folowed dame Isabell the quenes courte that was kynge Edwards mo∣der and beset hys peny worth with the offycers of the quenes house holde in the same manere that the kynges offycers dyde. And so he made his takynge / as touchynge of vytayle and also of caryages / and all he dyde for bycause of ex∣pencys / and to gadre tresoure / And so he dyde without nombre in all that he myght. ¶Tho had he made hym wonder preuy wyth the que∣ne Isabell / And so moche lordshyppe and rete we had / that all the grete lordes of Englonde of hym were adrad wherfore the kyng and his counseylle / to warde hym were agreued / And ordeyned amonge them to vndo hym thorou∣ghe pure reason and lawe for cause that kynge Edwarde that was y
e
 kȳges fader traytoursly thrugh hym was murdred in the castel of Corf as before is sayde more playnly in some parte of his boke / of his deth. ¶And some that were of the kynges counseyll louyd Mortymer / & tol¦de hym in preuyte / how that y
e
 kynge & counsel were aboute from daye to daye / hym for to dy∣stroye and vndo wherfore Mortymer was so¦re anoyed & angry as the deuyll ayenst them of the kynges counseyll / & say he wolde of them be auenged / how so euer he toke on. ¶It was not longe afterwarde / that kynge Edward & dame Phylyp his wyf / & dame Isabell the kyn¦ges moder. and syr Roger Mortymer / ne wen∣te vnto Notyngham there for to soiurne / And so it befell that quene Isabel thrugh coūseyll of Mortymer / toke to her the keyes of the yates of the castell of Notyngham. So that no man myght come nother in ne out but thrugh com∣maundement of Mortymer / ne the kynge / ne none his coūseylle. ¶And that tyme it fel. that the Mortymer as a deuyll for wrath bolled / & also for wrathe that he had ayenst the kynges men Edward / and pryncypally ayenst theym that had hym accusyd to the kynge / of the deth of syr Edwarde his fader. ¶And pryuely a coū¦seyll was take bytwene quene Isabell and the Mortymer and the bysshop of Lyncoln & syre Symōde of Bedford / and syr Hugh of Trom∣pyngton / & other preuy of theyr counseyll / for to vndo theym all that the Mortymer had ac∣cusyd vnto the kynge of his faders deth / of tre¦ason & of felonye. ¶Wherfore all tho that we∣re of the kynges coūseyll / whan they wist of the Mortymers castynge: pryuely came to kynge Edwarde and sayd / that Mortymer wold the¦ym dystroye / bycause that they had hym accu∣syd of kynge Edwardes dethe. his fader \ And prayed hym that he wolde mayntene them in theyr ryght. ¶And thyse were the lordes that pursued this quarell / Syr wyllyam of Moun¦tagu / syr wyllyam de Bohum / Syr wyllyam his broder / syr Rauf Stafforde / syr Robert of Herforde / syr wyllyam of Clynton / syr Iohan Neuell of Hornby and many other of theyr cō∣sent. And all thyse swore vpon a boke to mayn¦tene the quarell / in as moche as they myghte. And it befell so after· that syr wyllyam Moun∣tagu ne none of the kynges frendes muste not be herberowed in the castell for the Mortyme
 but went and toke theyr herberowe in dyuerse place of the twone of Nothyngham. And tho were they sore a ferde / leest that mortymer shol¦de theym dystroye. And in haste they came vn¦to kyng Edward syr wyllyam of Mauntagu and other that were in the castell. And pryuely hym tolde / that he ne none of hys cōpany. shol¦de not take the Mortymer. without counseyll & helpe of wyllyam of Elande. constable of the same castell. ¶Now truelye sayd the kynge I loue you well· & therfore I counseyl you that ye go to the forsayd conestable / & commaūde hym in my name / that he be your frende and youre helpe / for to take the mortymer / al thynge yleft vpon peryll of lyf & lym̄e. ¶Tho sayd Moun¦tagu Syr my lorde graunt mercy ¶Tho wen¦te forthe the forsayd Mountagu / and came to the Conestable of the castell / and tolde hym the kynges wyll. ¶And he answerde and sayde· The kynges wyll sholde be doone in as moche as he myghte. and that he wolde not spare for no manere of dethe / And that he swore and ma¦de his othe. ¶Tho sayde syr wyllyam of Moū∣tagu to the constable / in herynge of them alle. that were helpynge to the same quarell. Now certes dere frende / vs behouyth to werke & do


by your aduys for to take the Mortymer / syth that ye be keper of the castell. and hath the key¦es in your warde. ¶Syr sayd the Constable / wyll ye vnderstonde / that the castell yates ben lockyd with the keyes that dame Isabell sent hyther. and by nyght she hath the keyes ther of and layeth them vnder the lursell of the bedde vnto the morowe. and so ye maye not come in to the castell by the yates / by no manere of wy¦se / But I knowe an aleye that stretchythoute of the warde vnder the erthe in to the for sayde castell / that gothe in to the weste. whiche aleye dame Isabel the quene / ne none of her men ne the Mortymer / ne none of his company kno∣with it not. And so I shall lede you thrugh y
e
 a∣ley / & so ye shall come in to the castell withoute aspyenge of ony man y
t
 are your enmyes. And the same nyghe syr wyllyam Mountagu / & all the lordes of his quarell / & the same Constable also went theym to hors / & made semblaūt as it were for to go out of Mortymers syght But anone as Mortymer harde thys tydynges / he wende y
t
 they wolde haue gone ouer see for fere of hym. ¶And anone ryght he & his cōpanye toke a coūseyll amonge theym for to lete theyr passage / & snetelletters anone to the porters so that none of the grete lordes sholde go home to theyr owned coūtrees / but yf they were arested & take. And amonge other thynges wyllyam Elande Conestable of the for sayd castell. pry∣uely ladde syre wyllyam of Mountagu & hys company by the for sayd waye vnder the erth / tyll they came in to the castell & went vp in to the toure that Mortymer was in. But syr Hu¦ghe of Trompynton theym ascryed hydously and sayd a traytours it is all for nought. that ye ben comyn in to this castell ye shall deye yet an euell dethe euerychone. And anone one of theim that was in Mountages company vp wyth a mace / and smote the same Hugh vpon the heed / that the brayne braste out and fell on the grounde / and soo was he deed of an euyll deth. ¶Tho toke they mortymer as he armyd hym at the toures dore / whan he herde the noy¦se of theym for drede. ¶And whan the quene Isablell sawe that the Mortymer was taken she made moche sorowe in herte / & thyse wor∣des vnto theym she sayd / Now fayre syres / I praye you that ye doo noo harme to his body a thy knyght our welbeloued frende and our de¦re cosyn. ¶Tho wente they thens / and came and brought Mortymer / and presentyd hym vnto kynge Edwarde / & he commaunded to brynge hym in saue warde. ¶But anone as they that were consentynge vnto mortymers doynge / herde tell that he was taken they wen¦te & hydde them / and pryuely by nyght wente out of the towne eche one his waye / with heuy herte and mornynge chere & lyued vpon theyr londes as well as they myghte. ¶And that sa∣me yere that Mortymer was take. He hadde .ix. score knyghtes without quyres and sergaū¦tes of armys / & fote men / And then̄e was mor¦tymer ladde to London / and syr Edmonde of Bedforde was ladde wyth hym / and was ta∣ken to y
e
 constable of the toure to kepe. ¶But after warde was the Mortymers lyfe examy∣ned at westmestre before the kynge / and befo∣re all the geate lordes of Englonde / for peryll that myght falle to the reame / And to enquer
 also whiche were consentynge to syr Edwar∣des dethe the kynges fader / & also thrugh who¦me the Scottes escaped fro Stanhope in scot¦londe / without leue of kynge Edwarde. And also how y
e
 chartre of ragman was delyuered vnto the Scottes them the homages and feau¦tees of the lordes of Scotlōde were conteyned that the Scottes sholde doo euer more to the Englysshe kynge for the reame of Scotlond / wherfore he was Iugyd to be drawen and han¦gyd for his treason / And this myscheyf came vnto hym on saynt Andrewes euen. In the ye¦re of the Incarnacyon of our lorde Ihesu cry∣ste .M.CCC.xxx.






¶Howe kynge Edwarde gate ayen vnto hym gracyously the homages and feautees of Scotlonde / wherof he was put oute thrughe y
e
 false counseyll of the quene Isabell his moder & syre Roger Mortymer. that was newely made Erle of Matche.


NOw haue ye herde how Iohan Bayl∣lol in the tyme of peas was chosen to be kynge of Scotlonde for cause that he came of the eldest doughter of the Erle Dauyd of Hun¦tyngton / that was kynge Alysanders broder of Scotlond / that deyed without heyre of hys body begoten / And how this Iohan made his feaute and homage to kynge Edwarde / Hen∣ryes sone the thyrde. for his londes of Scotlon¦de / And how he afterwarde with sayd hys ho¦mage / thrugh counseyll of the Scottes / in the yere of our lorde ·M.CC.lxxiiii. and sente vn¦to


the pope thrugh. a fals suggestyō that he ma¦de hys othe vnto the forsayd kynge Edwarde ouer hys estate and his wil / of the whyche othe the pope hym assoyled thrughe hys bullys to hym ysent. ¶And anone as kynge Edwarde wyst therof / he ordeyne anone hys barons and came vnto Berwyk / and cōquered the towne. at the whyche conquest there were slayne .xxv. thousande & .vii. hundred. & Bayllol that was kyng of Scotlond came & yeldyd hym to gode kynge Edwarde / & y
e
 kyng delyuered hym out of the toure of London. and all the grete lordes with hym y
t
 tho were taken at Berwyk & yaue theym saufconduyte / to goo into Scotlonde. And the Scottes sythe thrugh theyr falsnesse / warred vpon the good kynge Edwarde. And whan syr Iohan Bayloll kynge of Scotlonde sawe all this / he wente ouer see vnto Dunpier and lyued there vpon hys londes as well as he myght. tyll that y
e
 Scottes wolde amende the∣ym of theyr mysdedys and trespaas / and ladde with hym syr Edwarde his sone. wherfore the Scottes in dyspyte of hym callyd hym syr Io¦han Turnlabard / for bycause that he wolde not ne offend ne trespaas ayenst the good kyn∣ge Edwarde of Englonde. And soo he for soke hys reame of Scotlonde / and sette therof but lytyll pryce. And this syr Iohan dwellyd longe tyme in Fraunce / tyll that he deyed there & syr Edward his sone receyued hys herytage / and dyde homage to the kynge of Fraunce / for his londes of Dunpier / And so it befell afterwar∣de / that Edward that was Iohan Bayllols so¦ne / had with hym a squyre of Englond y
t
 was in yorke shyre / that was callyd Iohan of Bar¦naby / and this Edwarde Bayllol louyd hym moche / and was nyghe hym / & full preuy. And so this Iohn̄ of Barnaby was in debate with a Frenche man in the towne of Dunpier / & so he slewe hym and wente hys way in all the ha∣ste that he myghte in to the castell. For to haue socoure and helpe of hys lorde. And anone ca∣me offycers of the towne. to take Iohn̄ of Bar¦naby as a felon. and syr Edward his lorde hol¦pe hym / and rescowed hym / and by nyght ma¦de hym go out of the castell / and so he went hys waye and came in to Englonde withoute ony harme. ¶And whan the kyng of fraunce saw that syr Edwarde had rescowed his felon. He became wonder wrothe ayenst syr Edward. & anone lete hym arestyd and toke into hys hon∣des all his londes. Tho dwellyd syr 
 Edward in pryson / vnto the tyme that syr Henry of Be¦aumount came into fraunce / the whiche Hen¦ry somtyme was erle of Anguysshe in Scot∣londe and was put out therof whan chacorde¦ment was bytwene Englonde and Scotlond thrugh the quene Isabell and syr Roger Mor¦tymer and theyr company for y
e
 moryage that she made bytwene Dauyd / that was Roberte Brus sone and dame Iohanne of Tour kyn¦ge Edwards syster of Englond / & well vnder¦stonde thys / that att the ende he sholde come to his ryght / but yf it were syre Edwarde Bayl¦loll / that was ryght heyre of the reame of Scot¦londe. ¶And the kyng of fraunce Lowys lo∣uyd moche this syr Henry. And he was wyth hym full preuy / and thought for to make a de∣lyueraunce of syr Edward Baylloll / yf he my¦ghte in ony maner of wyse. ¶Tho prayed he the kynge that he wolde of his grace gaūt hym syre Edwarde Bayllols body / vnto the nexte parlement. that he myght lyue with hys owne rentes in the meane tyme / and that he myghte stonde to be Iugyd with his perys att the par∣lement. And the kynge grauntyd hym his pray¦er / and made the forsayde Edwarde to be dely¦uered out of pryson / in the manere aboue sayd And anone as he was out of pryson syr Henry toke hym forth with hym & ladde hym in to en∣glonde / and made hym dwelle pryuely att the manere of Sandhall vpon Ouse in yorke shy¦re with the lady Vescy. And soo he ordeyned hym there an huge retenewe of Englysshmen and also of alyuntes / for to conquere ayen his herytage / and so he yaue moche syluer vnto y
e
 souldyours and alyauntes for to helpe hym 
 And they behyght for to helpe hym in that they myght / but they faylled hym att hys moost ne∣de. ¶And at that tyme Dauyd erle of Moryf herde tell how that syr Edward Bayloll was pryuely come into englond. And came to hym and made wyth hym gerte Ioye of his comyn¦ge and sayd vnto hym and behyght hym that all the greate lordes of Englonde / sholde be to hym entendaunte / & sholde hym holde for kyn∣ge as ryght heyre of Scotlōde / and dyd to hym feaute· ¶Tho came syr Henry of Beaumon¦te to kynge edwarde of Englonde. And pray¦ed hym in the waye of charyte / that he wolde graunt of his greate vnto syr Edwarde Bayl¦loll that he myghte sau
ly goo by londe frome


Sandhall / vnto Scotlonde / to conquere hys ryght & herytaunce in Scotlond. ¶The kyn¦ge answerde & sayde / yf that I suffre Bayllol. go thrugh my londe in to Scotlonde. thenne the people wolde saye / y
t
 I shold be assentynge vnto the company. ¶Now syr I praye you y
t
 ye wolde yeue hym leue to take with hym soul∣dyours of Englysshmen that they myght sauf¦ly lede hym thrugh your londe to Scotlonde / And syr vpno thys couenaunte that yf it so be∣fall / as god it for bydde that he dyscomfyted in bytayll thrugh the Scottes / that I and also al the lordes that holde with Bayllol / ben for e∣uer more out of our rentes that we haue in en∣glonde. And there the kynge vppon this coue∣naunte / grauntyd theyr bone / as towchynge hym / and tho that were of the same quarell the whiche claymed for to haue londes and rentes in the reame of Englonde And thyse were the names of tho lordes that pursued this for sayd matere and quarell. ¶That is to saye / syr Ed¦warde Bayllol / the whiche chalengyd the rea¦me of Scotlonde. syr Henry Beaumonte erle of Angusshe / syr Dauyd of Stroboly erle of a theles / syr Geffray of Mombraye / walter Co¦myn and many other that were put out of the¦yr herytage in Sctlonde whan the peas was made bytwene Englonde and Scotlonde as before is sayde / And ye shall vnderstonde that thyse lordes tooke with theym fyue houndred men of armes. and two thousande Archers & of fote men. and tho wente in to shyppe at Ra∣uen. pore / & sayled by the see / tylle that they ca∣me vnto Scotlond. and came to londe at Kyn¦kehorne .xii. myle fro saynt Iohannes towne / And anone sent out there shyppes agayne / for that they shold not be hurte / ne empeyred / ney¦ther taht no man sholde go in to the shyppes a∣gayne thoughe that they had nede / but abybe all perylles and not flee but stonde / and rather suffre deth than flee for to mayntene their true quarell. whan the erle of Fyffe. a fyers man & a sterne / harde that Bayllol was come / for to taste the londe of Scotlond / he came in hast to Kynke horne / with ·iii. thousand Scottes / for to dystroye hym / that he shold not come to lon¦de / But syr Edwarde Bayllol and his compa¦ny there hym dyscomfyted / at the whiche dys∣comfyture syr Alysāder Seton was there slay¦ne / & many other. The Erle of Fyffe / was th
 sore and full euyll ashamyd / that so lytyll a cō∣pany had hym dyscomfyted / and shamefully put hym and all his company that were alyue for to flee. ¶Tho came syr Edwarde Bayllol and toke the coō tree all aboute hym. tyll he ca∣me vnto the abbay of Dūfermlin. and ther he founde vytaylles for hym and for his folke / & amonge all other thynge he founde in a cham¦bre aboute fyue houndred of grete staues of

For the power of Scotlonde may eue∣ry wexe and encrece and we maye not so doo. And we ben but lytylle people ayenste theym wherfore I praye you for the loue of almyghty god make we vs bolde and hardy and that we may myghtely take the Scottes this nyght / & boldly werre vpon theym. and lete vs pursue theym thys nyghte.

And therfore our kyn¦ge with all his people wente and sought thys waye ferre vp to Parys warde and ther was all the ryall power of Fraunce assembled and redy to gyue hym batayll & for to dystroye alle his people. But almyghte god was hys guyde and saued hym & al his menye & defended hym of hys enmyes power and purpose thanked be god that saued so hys owne knyght & kynge in his ryghtfull tytle. ¶And than our kynge be holdynge and seyenge the grete multytude and nombre of his enmyes to wythstande his way and gyue hym batayll / than the kynge wyth a meke herte & a good spyryte lyft vp his hondes to almyghty god & be souhht hym of hys helpe and socoure and that daye to saue his trewe ser¦uauntes. And than oure kynge gadred all his lordes & other peple about & bad them all to be of gode there / for they sholde haue a fayre daye and a gracyous vyctorye & the better of all the¦yr enemyes / and prayed thē alle to make them redy vnto the batayll. For he wolde rather be deed that daye in the felde. than to be taken of his enmyes for he wold neuer put the reame of Englonde to raumsome for his persone.


¶An the duke of yorke fell on hys knees and besought y

rfore Beda .li.iii. ca. ii. speketh in this manere. Ni¦nian the hooly man conuerted the southe Pyt¦tes. Afterwarde the Saxons come and made that Countree longe to Brenicia the Northe partye of Northumberlonde vnto the tyme that Kynadius Alpinus sone kynge of Scotlō¦de put out of the Pyctes and made that coun¦tree that lyeth bytwene Twede and the Scot¦tesshe see longe to his kyngdome. ¶Beda .li· ca. i. Afterwarde longe tyme the Scottes we¦re ledde by duke Renda and came oute of Ir¦londe that is propre coūtree Scottes and with loue or with strenthe made hym a place fast by the Pyctes in the Northe syde of that arme of


the see / that breketh in to the londe in the weste syde that departed in olde tyme bytwene Bry¦tons and Pyctes. Of thys Duke Renda the Scottes hadde the name and were caled Dar¦lendinas as it were Rendaes parte / for in her speche a parte is called dall. ¶Girp̄. The pyc¦tes myghte haue noo wyues of Brytons bute they toke hem wyues of Irysshe Scottes and promysed hem fayre for to dwell wyth theym And graunted hym a londe by the see syde / the¦re the see is nowe That londe is called nowe. Galleway Marianus Irysshe Scottesshe lō∣de datte Argall that is Scotten clyfe for Scot¦tes londed there for to doo tharme to the Bry∣tons or for that place is nexte to Irlonde for to come a londe in Brytayne. ¶Beda. And soo the Scottes after Brytons and Pryctes made the thyrde people dwellynge in Brytayne. ¶R. Thenne after that come Saxons atte prayenge of the Brytons to helpe them ayenst the Scottes and Pyctes. ¶And the Brytons were soone put out in to waies. And Suxons occupyed the Londe lytell and lytell. And efte more to the Scottysshe see. And soo Saxoas made the fourthe manere of men in the ylonde of Brytayne. ¶Beda li.v. ca. ix. For Saxons and Angels came oute of Germania / yet so∣me Brytons that dwelled nyghe callen hem shortly Germans. ¶R. Netheles abowte the yere of our lorde .viii. hondred Egbartus kyn¦ge of westsaxon commaunded and badde alle men calle the men of the londe Englysshmen. ¶Alfre. Thenne after that the Canes pursu∣ed the londe. Abowte two hondred yere / that is for to saye fro the for sayde Egbarteus tyme vnto saynt Edwardes tyme / and made the fy¦fte manere of people in the londe / Bute they faylde after warde. Atte laste come Normans vnto duke wyllyam and subdued Englysshe∣men / and yet kepe they the londe and they ma∣de the 
y
the people in the ylonde. But in the fyrste kynge Henryes tyme come many Fle∣mynges and receyued a dwellynege place for a tyme be syde Maylros in the weste syde of En¦londe / and made the seuenth people in the ylon¦de. Netheles by commaundement of the same kynge they were put thens and dryuen to Ha∣uer fordes syde in the west syde of wales. ¶R. And soo nowe in Brytayne Danes and Pyc∣tes fayllen all out / and fyue nacyons dwellen ther in that been Scottes in Albania / that is Scotlond. Brytayne in Chambrya that is wa¦les. but that Flemynges dwelle in that is west wales. And normans & Englysshmen ben med¦led in all the ylond / for is now doubte in story∣es how & in what manere they were put a way & dystroyed out of Brytayne. Now it is to de¦clare how the Pyctes were dystroyed & sayled. ¶Girp̄. ca. vii. Brytayn was somtyme occu∣pyed with Saxons / & peas was made and sta¦blysshed with the Pyctes / thenne the Scottes that came with the Pyctes sawe that the Pyc¦tes were nobler of dedes & better mē of armes though they were lasse in nombre than the scot¦tes Then̄e the Scottes hauynge therof enuye torned to theyr naturall treason y
t
 they haue oft vsed for in treason they passe other mē and ben traytours as it were by kynde. For they pray¦ed all the Pyctes & specyally the grete of them to a feest. & wayted her tyme whan the Pyctes were mery & had well dronke they drew vp nay¦les that helde vp holowe bēches vnder the pyc∣tes & the pyctes vnware sodaynly fyll in ouer the hammes into a wonderfull pytfull. Then the Scottes fell on the Pyctes and slewe thē & left none alyue. And so of two maner people y
e
 better warryours were holy destroyed. but the other y
t
 ben the Scotes whiche ben traytours all vnlyke to the pyctes toke prouffyte by that fals treason / for they tooke alle that londe and holde it yet vnto thys tyme and it. Scotlonde after hyr owne name / In kynge Edgars tyme Kynadin Alpinus sone was duke and leder of the Scottes and warred in Pycte londe / and destryyed the Pyctes. He warred syx sythes in Saxon and tooke all the londe that is bytwe∣ne Twede and the Scottysshe see with wron∣ge and wyth strengthe.






¶Of the langages of maners and vsuge of the people of that londe. ca. xv·


AS it is knowen howe manye manere of people ben in thys ylonde there been also so many langages and tonges. Netheles walsshe and scottes that ben not medled with other nacyons kepe yet theyr langage and spe¦che but yet the Scottes that were somtyme cō¦federate and dwelled with Pyctes drawe som¦what after theyr speche / But the Flemynges that dwell in the west syde of wales haue lefte her straunge speche and speken lyke to Sax∣ons / also Englysshemen though they had fro the begynnynge thre manere of speches. Sou¦therne


Northern & myddell speche in the myd¦dell of the londe as they come of thre maner of people. Germania. Netheles by commixyon and mydlynge fyrste with Danes & afterwar∣de with Normans in many thynges the coun¦tree langage is appared / for some vse straunge wlaffynge chyterynge harrynge gartynge and grysbytynge. ¶This apparynge of the lan¦gage cometh of two thynges / one bycause that chyldren that gone to scole lerne to speke fyrste Englysshe / and than ben compelled to constre hys lessōs in Frensshe & that haue ben vsed syn the Normans come into Englonde. Also gen∣tylmens chyldren be lerned and taught frome theyr youthe to speke Frensshe / & vp londessh∣men wyll counterfete and lyken hymself to gē∣tylmen and are besy to speke / frensshe for to be more sette by / wherfore it is sayde by a comyn prouerbe.

 Englysshmen haue so grete dyuersy¦te in theyr owne langage in sowne & in spekyn¦ge of it whiche is all in one ylonde.

 cause be y
t
 they be nyght to the alyens that speke straunge¦ly. And also by cause the kynges of Englon¦de abyde and dwelle more in the southe counte¦ree than in the north countree. The cause why they abyde moore the south countre than in the north countree / is by cause that there is better corne londe more people moo noble cytees and mo profytable hauens in the southe countree than in the northe countree.

FOr the maners and doynge of walsshe∣men and of scottes ben to fore somwhat declared. Nowe I purpose to telle and decla∣re the condycyons of the medled people of Eng¦londe. But the Flemynges that been in the west syde of wales ben now all torned as they were Englysshmen by cause they companye with Englysshmen.

And vnesy also vnpacyent of peas / enemyes of besynes / and full of slouth. ¶Wilhel. de pon .li.iii. sayth


That whan they haue destroyed theyr enemy¦es all to the grounde / then̄e they fyghten wyth theymself and sleeth eche other / as voyde and an empty stomak werketh in it selfe. ¶R. Ne∣theles men of the southe ben esyer & moree myl∣de than men of the North. For they ben more vnstable and more cruell & more vnesy. The myddell men ben parteners with bothe.

¶Of the meruaylles and wōders of Irlonde. ca. xxviii.


MAny men tellen that in the northe syde of Irlonde is the londe of lyfe. In that ylonde no man maye deye but whan they ben olde and vexed wyth greate sykenes / they ben borne out in to the nexte londe and deye there. There is an other ylonde in Irlonde that noo womman ther in may bere a childe / but yet she may conceyue. Also there is an ylonde in why¦che no dede body maye roten. In vltonia that is Vlstre is an ylonde in a lake wōderly depar¦ted in twene In that one parte is grete dystur¦baunce and dyscomforth of frendes & in that other partye grete lykyng and comforth of ho¦ly angels There is also saynt Patryks purga¦tory that was shewed at hys prayer to confer∣me hys prechynge & hys lore whan he preched to mysbyleued men of sorowe and payne that euyll mē sho
 suffre for ther euyll werkes. And of Ioye and of blysse y
e
 gode men shall receyue for ther holy dedes he telleth that who that suf∣freth the paynes of purgatory / yf it be enioy∣ned hym for penaunce he shall neuer suffre the paynes of hell / but he deye fynally withon re∣pentaunce of synne / as the ensample. is sette more full at this chapytre ende. ¶Treuisa. But truly noman maye be saued but yf he be very repentaunce what someuer penaunce he do / and euery man that is very repentaunt as hys lyues ende shall be sekerly saued / though
 he neuer here of saynt Patryks purgatorye.


There is an ylond in cona
te Sale / that is in y
e
 see of Conaccia halowed by saynt Brandon y
t
 hath no myse there dede bodyes ben not buryed but bē kept out of the erth & roten not. In Ma¦monia is a wel who y
t
 wassheth hym with that water of y
e
 welle he shall waxe / hore on his heed There is an other wel in Vltonia who someuer is wasshē therin he shall neuer wexe hore after warde / There is a welle in Mounstre or Ma¦monia \ yf ony mā touche that welle anone shal falle grete rayne in alle the prouȳce / & that ray¦ne shalle neuer cesse / tyll a preste that is a clene mayden synge a masse in a chapell that is faste by & blesse the water / & wyth mylke of a cowe y
t
 is of one her besprynge the welle. & so reconcyle the welle in this staunge manere. At Glyndal can aboute the oratory of Saynt Keywyn wy¦ches beryth apples as it were apple trees and ben moore holsome than sauery. That holy sa¦ynt brought forthe these apples by prayers for to hele his shylde that was seke. There is a la∣ke in Vlstre and moche fysshe therin / whyche is .xxx. myle in lengthe and. in brede. The Ry∣uer Ban renneth out of that lake into the nor¦the Occean and mē saye that thys lake began̄e in this manere. There were men in that coun¦tree that were of euyll lyuynge coeuntes cūbru∣tis. And there was a well in that londe in gre¦te reuerence of olde tyme / And all waye coue∣red / yf it were lefte vncouered the welle wolde ryse and drowned all the londe. And soo it hap¦ped that a wooman wente to that welle for to fetche water & hyed her fast to her chyld y
t
 wept in the cradell / & left the welle vncouered / then the welle sprange soo faste that is drowned the woman and her chylde & made all the countree a lake and a fysshe ponde. for to preue that thys is soo there it is greate argument / that whan the weder is clere / fysshers of that water see in the rounde vnder the water rounde toures and hyghe shapen as steples and chyrches of that londe. In the north syde of Irlonde in the coun¦tre of Ossyyryens euery .vii. yere at the prayer of an hooly Abbot / tweyne that ben wedded a man and a woman muste nedes be exyled and forshapen in to lyknes of wolues & abyde out .vii. yere. And atte ende of .vii. yere. yf they ly∣ue they come home agayne / And take agayne theyr owne shappe / And than shall other twey¦ne goo forthe in theyr stede and soo forshapen for other .vii. yere. There is a lake in thys lon¦de yf a poole of tree pyghte and stycked therin that parte of the shafte or poole. That is in the erth shall torne in to yron / And that par
e that abydeth in the water shalle torne into stone / And the parte that abydeth aboue shall be tree in his owne kynde. Also there is a lake that tor¦nethe hasell in to asshe and asshe in to hasell yf it be done therin. Also in Irlonde ben thre Sa¦mon lepes there as samons lepe ayenste a Ro∣che of longe speres lenthe. Also in Leginia is a pounde there ben seen colmans byrdes. The berdes been called certelles and come homely to mannes honde but yf men do hym wronge or harme. They gone a waye and come notte a¦gayne / and the water there shall be bytter and stynke / and he that dyde the wronge shall not a stert wythoute wretche and myschyef but yf he do amendes. ¶R. As touchynge Patryks purgatorye. ye shalle vnderstonde Saynt Pa¦tyrk that was abbote and not byshoppe why∣le he prechyd in Irlonde laboured and studyed for to torne thylke wycked men that lyued as beestes oute other euyll lyf for drede of paynes of helle / and for to conferme hem to good lyfe and they sayde they wolde not torne but some of theim myghte knowe som what of the grete paynes and also of the blesse that he spake of. Thenne saynt Patryk prayed to god almygh∣ty therfore / ouer lorde Ihesu Cryste appyered to saynt Patryk and toke hym a staffe & ladde hȳ in to a wylde place and shewed hym there a rounde pytte that was derke wythin and say∣de / that yf a man were very repentaunce and stable in byleue and wente into this pytte and walkede therin a daye and a nyghte he sholde see the lorowes and the paynes of euyll men / and the Ioye and blysse of good men. Thenne Cryste vanysshed oute of patryks syght 
 and saynt Patryk arered and buylded there a chyr∣che and putte therin chanons reguler and 
∣se the pytte aboute wyth a walle / and 
 in the chyrche yerde at the eest ende 
 chyr¦che and faste shette wyth a stronge 
. For noo man sholde nycely goo in wythout 
 of the bysshoppe or the poyour of the place. 
¦ny men wente in and come out agayne in Pa∣tryks tyme and tolde of paynes and Ioye th
 they hadde seen / and the meruaylles that they sawe been there yet wryten / and by cause ther of many men torned and were conuerted to ry¦ghte byleue. ¶And also many men went in



 c
me neuer agayne. In kynge stephens tyme 
ynge of Englōde a kynght y
t
 hyght Owayne 
 saynt Patryks purgatory & come a∣gayne & dwelled euer 
aft
 duryng his life ī nedes of thabbaye of Ludēsis y
t
 is of thordre Chyste∣ws & tolde manye wōdres y
t
 he hadde seē in Pa¦tryks purgatorye. ¶That place is called Pa¦tryks purgatorye / & y
e
 chirche is named Reglis Noo mā is enioyned for to goo into y
e
 purgato¦rye. But coūseylled y
t
 he sholde not come therin butte take vpō him other penaūce And yf a mā haue auowed & bestale & wyll nedes goo therin He shall fyrst go to y
e
 bysshoppe & thēne he shall be sēte with letters to the pryoure of the place & they bothe shal coūceylle hym to leue & yf he wil¦le nedes go therto he shalle be in prayers & in fas¦tynge xv. daies & after xv. dayes he shal be how seld & ledde to y
e
 dore of the purgatorye with pro¦cessyon & letany & yet he shall be coūseylled to le¦ue it / & yf he be stedefaste & wyll entre / the doore shal be opened & he blessed & goo in a goddes na¦me & holde forthe his waye / & the dore shall be shytte tylle y
e
 nexte daye / & whā the tyme is the pryoure shalle come & opene y
e
 dore. & yf the mā be comē he ledethe hym in to y
e
 chyrche wyth {pro}¦cessyō & there he shall be fyftene dayes in pray∣ers & fastynge.
