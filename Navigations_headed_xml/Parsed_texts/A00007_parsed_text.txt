The prologue.


I
N so moche y
t
 it is necessary to all creatures of chrysten rely∣gion / or of fals religyon or gen tyles & machomytes to knowe theyr prynce or pryces y
t
 regne vpon them / & them to obey. So it is cō∣modyous to knowe theyr noble actes & dedes / & the circūstaūce of theyr lyues. Therfore in y
e
 yere of our lorde. M .cccc .lxxxiij. the .xxij. yere of y
e
 regne of kynge Edward the fourth at saynt Albons / so that all men may know y
e
 actes namely of our noble kynges of englonde / is com pyled togyder this boke / & more ouer is trāslated out of latyn in to englysshe / fro the begȳnynge of y
e
 worlde / the lignage of Chryst from Adā tyll it be comen to Da uid / & fro Dauid / the kynges of israel & of iewes / y
e
 hye by¦s;shops in theyr dayes with y
e
 iudges & {pro}phetes. The .iiij. prin¦cypall realines of the worlde / y
t
 is to say Babylon / Perce / Grece / & Rome / & all y
e
 emperours of Rome & popes by ordre / & theyr names: & many a notable fader: w
t
 certayne of theyr actes / as more playn∣ly ensueth. And here ben rehersed y
e
 na∣mes of y
e
 auctours y
t
 trāslated these cro∣nycles specially. Geffray Nūmoth mon ke in his boke of Brute / saynt Bede in y
e
 actes of englonde. Also Bede in his boke of tymes. Gyldas in y
e
 actes of Britayn. Willyam Malinesbury mōke in y
e
 actes of kynges of englond & bysshops. Cassi∣der{us} of y
e
 actes of emperours & bysshops Saynt Austin de ci. dei. Cit{us} Liuius de gestis romano{rum}. Martyn penitency ary to y
e
 pope in his cronycles of emperours & bysshops / & namely Theobaldus car∣tusiensis cōteynynge in his boke y
e
 pro∣gresse of all notable faders / fro y
e
 begyn∣nynge of y
e
 worlde vnto our tyme / w
t
 the notable actes of y
e
 same. ¶ In this new trāslacyon are cōteyned many notable & meruaylous thinges / & those ben alled∣ged by auctoryte of many famous 
∣kes. And y
t
 euery man may knowe how these cronycles bē ordred / ye shal vnder∣stande y
t
 this boke is deuyded in to .vij. partes. Of y
e
 whiche the fyrst parte con teyneth from Adam tyll Brute came in to Britayne. The seconde parte cōteyneth frō Brute came fyrst in to englonde vn∣to the cite of Rome was buylded by Ro∣mul{us}. The thyrde parte cōteyneth syth Rome was buylded vnto Chryst was borne of our lady virgyn Marye. The fourth parte frō thens vnto y
e
 comynge of y
e
 saxons in to englonde: The .v. parte from thens vnto the comyng of danes. The .vj. parte frō thens vnto y
e
 comynge of y
e
 normans. The .v. parte fro y
e
 nor∣mans vnto our tyme / which is vnder y
e
 regne of kyng Edwarde y
e
 fourth. 
. yere / whose noble cronycles by custome may not be seen. ¶ And so in euery part of these .vij. partyes be shewed y
e
 moost and necessary actes of all the kynges of englonde / & theyr names wryten aboue in y
e
 margent / y
t
 euery man may fynde them soone. And afore y
e
 kynges of eng∣londes actes ben wryten / there is wry-ten y
e
 lignage of Chryst frō Adam tyll y
•
 chryst was borne of our lady w
t
 the hye bysshops & iudges y
t
 were in y
e
 tyme & certayne of theyr actes necessary tyll it be comen where Chryst was borne & af¦ter that chryst was borne & Peter was pope of Rome / is shewed by ordre y
e
 na∣mes of all y
e
 popes & emperours of Ro∣me afore & after / with certayne of theyr actes breuyately / & many other dyuets thynges & meruayles in those mennes dayes fallynge. And it is shewed euery thȳge in his place / how many yere it fei after y
e
 begynnynge of y
e
 worlde / & how lōge afore y
•
 Chryst was borne / & whan y
•
 I come to Chryst was borne / thā it is wrytē how lōge any thynge fell after y
e
 Natyuite of Chryst. And this is y
e
 ordre of this boke / & of thynges spoken of.



ANd as to men desyryng to haue a very knowlege of these crony∣cles or of ony other / it is necessary to kno¦we .vj. thynges. ¶ The fyrst is y
e
 states of thynges / & those bē two. One is fro y
e
 begynnynge of y
e
 worlde vnto Chryst / y
e
 whiche is called the state of deuiacyon. The seconde is frō Chryst to y
e
 ende of y
e
 worlde / the whiche is called the state of reconstliacyon. ¶ The secōde thynge is the diuysyon of tymes / & those ben thre. One is afore the lawe of Moyses / & an other is vnder the lawe of Moyses / an other is vnder the lawe of grace after Chryst dyed. ¶ The thyrde is y
e
 gouer∣nyng of kyngdomes. And as for that ye must knowe / y
t
 though there were foure prȳcipal kyngdomes / that is to saye / of Babilon / of Persees / of Grekes / & of Ro¦maynes. Neuerthelesse as to y
e
 course of the worlde / & y
e
 ordre of holy scripture / y
e
 fyrst gouernyng was vnder faders / frō Adam vnto Moyses. The secōde vnder iudges / from Moyses vnto Saul. The thyrde vnder kȳges from Saul vnto zō¦robabel. The fourth vnder bisshops / frō zorobabel vnto Chryst. ¶ The fourth is y
e
 dyuersite of lawes / & those were fyue. The fyrst was y
e
 lawe of nature / & that was comyn to all men. The secōde is y
e
 lawe or custome of gentyles / whan y
t
 vn¦der kynge Nyno began y
e
 people to wor∣shyp false goddes. The thyrde is vnder the lawe wryten rose the lawe of iewes / whan circūcysyon deuyded y
e
 iewes frō other peple. The fourth is vnder chryst rose y
e
 lawe of christen men / whan fayth and grace of y
e
 sacramentes enformed y
e
 lyfe of men. The fyfth is vnder Macho¦met rose the lawe of sarasyns & turkes. ¶ The fyfth is the noblenesse or vnno∣blenes in dedes. And as to these / it is to knowe that .vij. persones ben redde / of whome the dedes many tymes are had in mynde in hystoryes. That is to wyte of a prynce in his realme / of a knyght in batayle / of a iudge in his place / of a bys∣shop in the clergye / of a polytyke man in the people / of an husbond man in the hous / & of an abbot in his chirche. And of these are wryten many tymes / the laudes of good men / and the punysshe∣mentes of the cursed men. ¶ The syxth is the true countynge of the yeres. And to that / it is to be knowen y
t
 there were viij. maner of nombrynge or countynge of the yeres. Thre after the Hebrewes. Thre after the Grekes. One of the Ro∣mayns. And one now is after the chry∣sten men. The Hebrewes thre maner of wyse begynneth theyr yere. After the Hebrewes there is the yere vsuall be∣gynnynge at Ianuary / y
e
 whiche they vse in couenauntes and bargeyns ma∣kyng. And the yere leyfull begynnynge at Marche / the whiche they vse in theyr cerymonyes. And the yere Emergens from Maye begynnynge / whan they wente from Egypte / they vse in theyr cronycles & calculacyons. ¶ The Gre∣kes nōbreth theyr yeres thre maner of wyse. Fyrst to the glory & Ioye of theyr victory coūteth theyr yeres from the de∣struccyon of Troye. The fyrst / y
•
 second / the thyrde / and the fourth. 
&c.
 ¶ Than after the chyualry began at the hyll of Olympus they notyfyed y
e
 yeres after the same Olimpiadū. And what Olim∣piades is / ye shall knowe after in the boke. The thyrde whan they began to haue lordshyp of all the worlde they no∣tifyed theyr yeres these maner of wyse. In the yere of the regne of Grekes / the fourth / the .x. the .xv. 
&c.
 as it is open in the boke of Machabeo{rum}. ¶ Than after the Romayns gouernynge the worlde / coūted & nōbred theyr yeres (ab vrbe con dita). ¶ The last of all chrystē men coū∣teth theyr yeres from y
e
 Incarnacyon of Chryst. And bycause we bē chrystē men


we vse moost to nombre / from y
e
 begyn∣nynge of the worlde vnto Chryst was borne. And fro Chryst was borne vnto our tyme. And this ordre is obserued & kepte in all the boke / of euery thynge in his place / as is sayd before.

¶ Hic incipit fructus temporum.


B
Ycause of these bokes made to tell what tyme of ony thȳ∣ge notable was. Therfore y
e
 begȳnynge of al tymes short¦ly shal be touched. For the whiche after doctours it is to be knowen / that foure thinges were made fyrst / & in one tyme & of one age / that is to wyte / the heuen imperyall / aungels nature / the matere of the foure elemētes / & tyme. And that doctours call werke of the creacion / the whiche was made (afore ony daye or nyght) of y
e
 myghty power of god / and was made of nothynge. ¶ Than after foloweth y
e
 werke of diuysyon / the whi¦che was made in thre of y
e
 fyrst dayes / in whiche is shewed y
e
 hygh wysdome of the maker. ¶ Than after foloweth y
e

e
 whiche is shewed the goodnes of the creatour / the whiche was made thre of y

Vt patet clare in textu gen̄ .j. ¶ The fyrst daye god made & deuyded the lyght from the derknes. ¶ The se∣conde daye god made & ordeyned the fir∣mament / & diuyded the water from the water. ¶ The thyrde daye god made in the whiche he gadered the waters in to one place / and the erth tho appered. ¶ The fourth daye god made / in y
e
 whi¦che daye he ordeyned y
e
 sonne / the mone and the sterres / & put them in y
e
 fyrma∣ment. ¶ The fyfth daye god made / in the whiche he ordeyned fysshes & fou∣les / & grete whales in y
e
 water. ¶ The syxth daye god ordeyned / in the whiche he made beest & man. ¶ The .vij. daye god made / & in y
t
 day he rested of all wer¦kes that he had ordeyned / not as in wer¦kyng beynge wery / but he ceased to ma¦ke mo newe creatures. Vide

Adam Eua.




I
N the fyrst yere of y
e
 worlde the syxth day god made and formed Adam in the felde da mastene / & Eua of his tyb∣bes / puttyng them in paradyse / & bade them to kepe his cōmaundement / that they sholde not ete of y
e
 fruyte of lyfe vn∣der the payne of deth. And y
e
 same daye y
t
 they had synned / anone he cast them out of paradyse in to y
e
 lōde of cursednes that they sholde lyue there w
t
 swerynge & sorowe tyll they dyed. Vide 
pl’a
 ge
. 
. ¶ This Adam was an holy man all y
•
 dayes of his lyfe / grete penan̄ce dayly he dyd. And he cōmaūded his chyldren to lyue ryghtwylly / & namely that they


sholde auoyde in all wyse from the com¦pany of Cayn & his chyldren. Nor that they shold not mary with none of them ¶ This mā Adam was our fyrst fader & for one synne put vs out of paradyse. But through his holy cōuersacion & pe∣naūce / he gaue vs ensample to come to the kyngdome of heuen. And he y
t
 wyll not folowe his holy cōuersacion & exam¦ple for one synne / ryghtwysly he can not complayne on hym / as we doo many. ¶ Seth sone to Adam was borne after the begynnynge of y
e
 worlde .C. and. xxx yeres / & lyued .ix .C. and .xij. But Moy∣ses ouerskypped an hondred of those / in the whiche Abel wepte in y
e
 vale of plo∣racion nygh Ebron. This Seth for the oyle of mercy to be goten went to para∣dyse. ¶ Delbora was syster to Abell. Abell was slayne of Cayn his broder. This Abell the fyrst martyr began the chirche of god. This man after Austyn made y
e
 cite of god / & he was y
e
 fyrst cite∣zyn of y
t
 cite. And bycause he was right wyse / our lorde receyued his offrynge. ¶ Calmana was wyfe to Cayn. This Cayn was a cursed man / & he made the fyrst erthly cite that euer in this worlde was / in y
t
 whiche he put his people for drede / in so moche as he vsed rauyne & violence. For he trusted suche thynge to be done to hym as he dyd to other / ther∣fore he put hym and his in to a sure pla∣ce. This man slewe his broder Abel for enuye / and he was punysshed of god / & wandred aboute in despayre. And was slayne of Lameth a blynde man.

e

t
 Hely in grete rest of body & soule tyll the comynge of Antechryst. Than they shall go forth for the cōfortacyon of good men. And they shall be crowned w
t
 the crowne of martyrdome.


MAtusale of Chrystes lyne lyued ix .C .lxix. yere. And was y
e

 euer ony scripture hath mȳde of. For whan he had lyued nygh .v .C. yere our lorde sayd to hȳ. Buylde y
e
 an hous & thou wylt / for yet thou shalt lyue fyue hondred yere. And he answered & sayd. For so lytell a tyme as .v. hondred yere I wyll buylde no hous. But rested vn∣der trees and hedges / and there slepte / as he was wont to do for a tyme.






¶ Anno mundi. M. iiij .C .liiij. Et ante Christi natiuitatē .iij. M. vij .C .xlv.


LAmeth was of the age of .vii. C lxxvij. yere. This Lameth was the first agaynst nature & good maners that ordeyned y
t
 a man might haue two wyues in doynge his auoutry. And he was sore punisshed of thē / for they gaue hȳ many a strype. For it is so y
t
 by what thynge a man synned / by the same he is punysshed. This Lameth slewe Cayn not wylfully. But whan he was olde & blynde he was ladde of achylde y
e
 whi∣che


trowed y
t
 he had seen a wylde beest / & sayd to his mayster y
t
 he shold shote / & so he slewe Cayn / wherfore for anger he slewe the chylde also. ¶ And it is to be knowen that all craftes or scyences ly∣beral / or hande craftes / or of phisyke ser¦uynge to y
e
 curiosite of man / are redde y
t
 they were foūden in the children of La∣meth. And for they dradde the peryll to come of the flode & of the fyre. Therfore Tuball graued the same craftes in two pyllers / the one was of marble / & that other of tyle or brycke. Tubal foūde first the crafte to werke gold & syluer & yren. And was the fyrst grauer y
t
 euer was. ¶ Iabe foūde fyrst tētoria for shepeher∣des / & pauylyons for other men. ¶ Iu∣bal foūde fyrst y
e
 crafte to playe vpon an harpe & organs / & other musycal instru¦mentes he vsed. ¶ Noema founde fyrst the crafte for to weue lynnen & wollen cloth / & to drawe threde of woll & flaxe. And afore that tyme the people vsed the skynnes of beestes for theyr clothes.






¶ Anno mundi. M. vj .C .xlij. Et ante Christi natiuitatem .iij. M .v .C. lvij.


¶Here begynneth the seconde age of the worlde durynge to Abraham. 



Noe.




THe shyppe of Noe had in length iij .C. cubytes / in brede .l. in alty¦tude .xxx. Vide 
pl’a
 gen̄ .vj. ¶ Knowe ye after doctours / that a cōuenyent payne this tyme was ordeyned to the worlde. For than lechery haboūded the whiche defouled mennes bodyes. And there by water y
e
 erth was wasshed & clensed / in sygne of y
e
 promesse y
t
 god made to man that there sholde neuer be suche a flode agayne. And the Raynbowe hath two prȳcypal colours / the whiche represent the two iudgementes. The water co∣lour representeth y
e
 flode that is passed. The fyre colour betokeneth the iudge∣ment to come / & fyre the whiche we cer¦taynly abyde in the ende of this worlde bycause couetyse shall haboūde / by fyre it shall be brente / as golde and syluer by the fyre is wonte to be clensed.


T
His Noe was a rightwyse man & foūde grace an
nst god. Whan Noe was .v .c. yere of age he had goten Cham / Sem and Iaphet. That tyme by y
e
 cōmaundement of god he be∣gan to make a shyppe / & he made it per∣fyte in an .C. yere / & the .C. yere cōplete our lorde appered agayne to hym & cō∣maūded y
t
 he w
t
 his wyfe & his chyldren & y
e
 wyues of them shold entre y
e
 shyppe with all maner of beestes & al maner of foules also. 
&c.
 And anone y
e
 flode came and stode aboue all hylles. 
v. cubytes. Vide plura gen̄ .vij. ¶ After the flode came grete dronkennes 
e
yd vnto Noe. And through the occasion of that dronkēnes he blyssed his two sones Sem and Ia¦phet / for y
e
 faders honour that they had to him / & for the honest shame that they couered mekely theyr faders membres whan he was slepynge. And his sone Cham for his scornynge & his vnreue∣rence he cursed. ¶ And here after saynt Austyn is made y
e
 fyrst mencyon of bon∣dage / and of noblenes cōtrary to it. For Noe sayd that Cham sholde be seruaūt in bondage to Sem and Iaphet for his



ureuerence. Neuerthelesse ye shall not trowe that all that descended of Cham were vnnoble men / & of no power. For they began fyrst to be myghty men of y
e
 erth. As it is open of Nemroth and the kynge of Chanaan & Astorum. Nor all of Sem & Iaphet were vertuous & no∣ble & myghty men / whan almoost eue∣rychone fell vnto y
e
 cryme of ydolatrye / and were oftentymes oppressed of other men. But this blessynge and this cur∣synge hath a respecte to vertue & vyce / for y
t
 whiche a man is called truly a no∣ble man or an vnnobleman. For he that is vertuous is a noble man / and he that is vnuertuous is not noble. The same maner of wyse those that foloweth the faythe of Abraham rather were called his chyldren than the Iewes / the whi∣che carnally descended from hym. Ne∣uertheles they had a spirytuall preuy∣lege of god for the faders merytes and his blessynge. And of these thre sones of Noe he beynge alyue (after the hystory of Philoms) were borne .xxiiij. M. and an .C. men / without women and chyl∣dren. And they had on them thre pryn∣ces / Nemroth / Iectan / and Sulphen.

And this Ia∣phet had seuen sones / as Gomor / Ma∣gog / Maday / Ianam / Tubal / Mosog / and Iras. And these .vij. gate sones & doughters / and of them came many a regyon. Vide plura genesis .xv. ¶ Ar∣phaxat soneto Sem lyued .CCC. and xxx. yere / and gate Elam / Assur / Lude / and Aram / & they gate many chyldren. Vt patet gene. ¶ This Assur bycause he wolde not rebell agaynst god in the edyfyenge of the toure of Babylon / as Nemroth dyd / therfore he was dryuen vnto the londe of Sennaar londe / whi∣che was ryght straūge to hym / & was not before enhabyted / the whiche was called after his name Assuria / and there he edyfyed a cite afterwarde named Ni niue / the whiche was the metropoly∣tane of all the kyngdome of Assuriorū. ¶ Chus sone vnto Cham was fader to Nemroth / this Nemroth was a gyaūt of .x. cubytes longe / and he began to be myghty in y
e
 worlde / and he is called a boystous hunter before god. This man began that wretched vyce of couetous∣nes by his tyranny / with y
t
 whiche vice euermore after this worlde is fulfylled. And y
e
 pryncypallest kyngdome that he had was Babylon / & he had Archade / Edyssa / Selencia / & the londe of Sen∣naar. ¶ Sale sone to Arphaxat lyued CCCC. and .xxxiij. yere / and of hym in scripture is nothynge wryten / but that Moyses nombred hym in the lyne that cometh of Chryst. This Sale ga
e a so∣ne that was named Heber / the whiche after the Hebrewes had the spiryte of prophecye. And of this Heber the He∣brewes ben named. For the Hebrewes tongue abode alone in his hous in y
e
 con¦fusyon of the language. And that lan∣guage was called mānes lāguage / the whiche euery man vsed afore the toure of Babylon was buylded. ¶ This He∣ber had two sones / and one was called Iectan / and that other Phaleg. This


Iectan through ensample of Nemroth descendynge fro Cham toke the prynce∣hode vpon the children of Sem. And he had .xiij. sones. But these people after Ierome are not knowen of vs for fernes of the coūtree / or mutacyon and chaun∣gynge of y

For in his hous abode the olde tongue alone and that was hebrewe. Wherfore after saynt Austyn / in hym appered a grete stedfastnesse of ryghtwysnesse / for this hous was free of that payne / as not cō∣sentynge to the buyldynge of the toure. Et

 londe of Perce / and there he taught them to adoure the fyre as god. He lefte his sone Belus in Babylon / whiche succeded af∣ter hym. And so his progenye obtayned that realme after many yeres. In this tyme began many kyngdomes / & the moost of all those kyngdomes was the kyngdome of Scitarū. But there were so many rude people in it y
t
 the cite was no worshipped / yet was it a myghty re¦gyon of dystaūce. And about this tyme began y
e
 kyngdome of Egypte the whi¦che was chaūged many tymes with dy¦uers alteracyons / & also it is spoken of many tymes ī scripture. ¶ Noblenes or gentylmen began about this sayd tyme And this noblenes or gentylmen was ordeyned for many causes. ¶ The fyrst cause was necessite / for whā mankynde grewe sore / & men were prompte & redy to do hurt & domage to other / it was ve∣ry necessary to w
t
stande y
e
 grete malyce of y
e
 cursed and wycked people agaynst good & ryghtwyse men. Therof a man is called gentylman or a noble man as before other in vertues notable. wherof saynt Ierom sayth. I se nothynge els in noblenes / or in gentylmen / but y
t
 they are boūden in a certayne necessite y
t
 they shall not recede fro the vertue / & the gen


tylnes of theyr noble aūcetours. ¶ The seconde was y
e
 dyuers worshyppyng of the people / for no man worshypped thā but as his naturall reason gaue / & they knewe not veryly what they shold wor¦ship / for they were so dull of wytte that they coude pondre no grete thynge / but that was publysshed by the comyn peo∣ple. Wherfore it was expediēt for theyr peace to be kepte that they sholde haue prynces of noble byrthe. ¶ The thyrde cause {pro}cedeth of some singuler strength Many tymes y
e
 comynaltees were gre∣ued through ennemyes comynge vpon them & than they sayd y
t
 who someuer wōlde defende them fro those perylles / he sholde haue the right of noblenes for hȳm & for his heyres for euermore. And in this maner of wyse many are redde to be noble men. ¶ The fourth cause of noblenes was haboundaūce of goodes. Somtyme y
e
 people were holden with grete penury of meet & drynke / & than they toke them & theyrs to some ryche man / that through that couenaūt they sholde tempre y
e
 grete straytnes of theyr honger / & after that they sholde knowe hym as theyr lorde & a noble man. Also there be foūde certayn noble men by the {pro}uysyon of god / though they were but fewe / of y
t
 whiche som abode ī vertue as Dauyd / & some fayled anone / as Saul and Ieroboam. And it is redde y
t
 many were noble men by tyrāny / of y
t
 whiche some were destroyed anone / & some abo∣de in stablenes / as paynyms myght.

And the Grekes perisshed wretchedly after that they had destroyed Troye bothe on the water and on the londe as they wente homewarde agayn. And that was the pryncypall date of theyr wrytynge af∣ter that vyctory. For they wrote theyr hystoryes and other wrytynges thus. Anno primo v

Albyon.




¶ Afore that I wyll speke of Brute it shall be shewed how the londe of englonde was fyrst named 
byon & for what cause it was so named.


IN the noble londe of Sirrie there was a noble kynge & myghty & a man of grete renome y
t
 was called Dio∣clesyan that well & worthely hȳ gouer∣ned & ruled through his noble chyualry So y
t
 he conquered all the londes about hym / so that almoost all y
e
 kynges of the worlde to hȳ were attendaūt. It befell thus y
t
 this Dioclesian spoused a gētyll damoysel y
t
 was wonders fayre / y
t
 was his vncles doughter Labana / & she lo∣ued hym as reason wolde / so y
t
 he gate on her .xxxiij. doughters / of y
t
 whiche y
e
 eldest was called Albyne / and these da∣moyselles whan they came vnto age be came so fayre y
t
 it was wonder / whereof Dioclesian anone let make a somnynge & cōmaunded by his lettres that all the kynges y
t
 helde of hym sholde come at a certayn daye as in his lettres were con∣teyned to make a feest royal. At whiche daye thyder they came / & brought with them admyrats / princes / dukes & noble ch
ualry. The feest was royally arayed and there they lyued in ioye and myrth ynough y
t
 it was wonder to wyte. And it befell thus y
e
 Dyoclesyan thought to mary his doughters amonge all those kynges y
t
 were at y
e
 solempnite. And so they spake & dyd that Albyne his eldest doughter & all her systers rychely were maryed to .xxxiij. kynges y
t
 were lordes of grete honour at this solempnite. And whan this was done euery kynge toke his wyfe & ladde them in to theyr owne coūtre / & there made them quenes. And it befell thus afterward y
t
 this dame Al∣bine became so stoute & so sterne that she tolde lytel pryce of her lorde / & of hyȳ had scorne & despyte / & wold not do his wyll but she wold haue her owne wyll in dy¦uers maters. And all her other systers euerychone bare them so euyll agaynst theyr lordes y
t
 it was wonder to wyte. And for as moche y
t
 them thought that theyr husbondes were not of so hye pa∣rentage comē as theyr fader. But those kynges y
t
 were theyr lordes wold haue chastysed them with fayre maner vpon al loue & frendshyp y
t
 they shold amende theyr euyll condicyons. But all was for nought / for they dyd theyr owne wyll in all thynge y
t
 them lyked & had of power Wherfore those .xxxiij. kynges vpon a tyme & often tymes bette theyr wyues For they wende that they wold hauea∣mended them & theyr tatches & wycked¦nes. But of suche condicions they were that for fayre speche & warnynge they dyd all y
e
 worse / & for betynges eftsones moche the worse. Wherfore the kyng y
t
 had wedded Albyne wrote the tatches and condicyons of his wyfe Albyne / & the lettre sent to Dyoclesyan her fader. And whan the other kynges herde that Albynes lorde had sente a lettre to Dio∣clesyan / anone they sente lettres sealed with theyr seales the condicyons & tat∣ches of theyr wyues. Whan the kynge Dioclesyan sawe & herde so many com∣playntes of his doughters / he was sore ashamed and became wonderssy angry and wroth toward his doughters / and thought how he myght amende it that they so mysoyd / & anone sent his lettres to the .xxxiij. kynges y
t
 they sholde come to hym / & brynge w
t
 them theyr wyues euerychone at a certayn day / for he wol¦de there chastyse them of theyr wycked¦nes yf he myght ī ony maner wyse. So that y
e
 kynges came all at y
e
 tyme & daye that tho was set bytwene hym and the kynges. Dioclesyan receyued them w
t
 moche honour / & made a solem
e feest vnto all that were vndernethe his lord∣shyp.


And the thyrde daye after that so∣lempnite y
e
 kynge Dioclesyan sent after his .xxxiij. doughters y
t
 they shold come & speke with hym in his chambre. And whā they were come / he spake to them of theyr wyckednes & of theyr cruelte / & angerly them reproued & blamed & said to them. That yf they wolde not be cha¦stysed / they sholde lose his loue for euer∣more. And whan y
e
 ladyes herde al this they became abasshed & gretly ashamed & sayd to theyr fader y
t
 they wolde make all amēdes. And so they departed out of theyr faders chambre. And Albyne that was y
e
 eldest syster ladde them all to her chambre / & tho made to voyde al y
t
 were therin / so y
t
 no psone was amonge them but she & her systers togyder. Thāsayd this Albyne. My fayre systers / well we knowe y
t
 the kyng our fader vs hath re∣proued / shamed & despysed / for bycause to make vs obedyent to our husbondes but certaynly y
t
 shall I neuer whyles y
e
 Ilyue / syth that I am come of a more hyer kynges blode than myn husbonde is. And whan she had thus said / all her systers sayd y
e
 same. And than sayd Al∣byne. Well I wote fayre systers / y
t
 our husbondes haue cōplayned vnto our fa¦der vpon vs / wherfore he hath vs thus foule reproued & despysed / wherfore sy∣sters my coūseyle is y
t
 this night whan our husbōdes ben a bedde / all we w
t
 one assent to kytte theyr throtes / & than we may be
 peas of them / & better we may do this vnder our faders power thā ony where els. And anone all y
e
 ladyes con∣sented & graūted to this counseyle. And whānyght was comen / the lordes & la¦dyes went to bedde. And anone as theyr lordes were a
ept / they kytte all theyr husbōdes throtes / & so they shewe them all. Whan Dioclesian theyr fader herde of this thynge / he became wroth ryght furyously agaynst his doughters / & a∣none he wole them all haue brent. But all the harons & lordes of S
rrye coun∣seyled not so for to do suche straytnes to his owne doughters / but shold boyde y
e
 londe of them for euermore / so that they neuer sholde come agayne / & so he dyd. And Dioclesyan y
t
 was theyr fader ano¦ne cōmaūded them to go in to a shyppe / & delyuered to them 
itayles for halfe a yere. And whan this was done / all the systers wente in to the shyppe & sayled forth in y
e
 see / & betoke all theyr frendes to Appolyn y
t
 was theyr god & so longe they sayled in the see 
yll at the last they came & arryued in an yle y
t
 was all wyl¦dernes. And whan dame 
yne was come to y
e
 londe & all her systers this 
¦byne went fyrst forth out of y
e
 shyppe & sayd to her other systers. For as moche as I am y
e
 eldest syster of all this cōpa∣ny / & first this londe haue take / & for as moche as my name is Alb
ne / I wyl 
 this londe be called Albion after my
 owne name. And anone all her systers graūted to her with a good wyll. Than went out of y
e
 shyppe all y
e
 systers & toke the londe Albion as theyr syster called it & there they went vp & downe & foūde neyther man ne woman ne chylde but wylde beestes of dyuers kyndes. And whan theyr 
ttayles were dispruded & sayled / they fedde them with herbes & fruytes in season of y
t
 yere / & so they 
∣ued as they best myght / & after y
t
 they toke flesshe of dyuers beestes & bera
 wonders fa
e / & so they desyred mānes company / & mānes kynde them fay
ed. And for here they wexed wonders cou∣ragyous of kynde / so that they desyred more mannes company than ony other solace or myrth. Whan the deuyll y
t
 per∣
yued went by dyuers coūtries & toke a body of y
e
 ayre / & lykyng natures sh
 of men / & came in to y
e
 londe of Albion / & lay by those women & shad tho natures


vpon them / & they conceyued & brought forth gyaūtes. Of whiche one was cal∣led Gogmagog / & another Langerigan And so they were named by dyuers na∣mes / & in this maner they came forth & were borne horryble gyaūtes in Albion And they dwelled in caues & in hylles at theyr wyll / & had the londe of Albion as them lyked / vnto y
e
 tyme that Brute arryued & came to Totnes y
t
 was in the yle of Albion / & there this Brute cōque∣red & discōfyted y
e
 gyaūtes aboue sayd.




¶ Explicit prima pars.








¶ Here begȳneth now how Brute was goten / & how he slewe fyrst his moder / & after his fader. And how he conquered Albyon / that after he named Brytayne after his owne name / that now is called Englonde / after the name of Engyst of Saxonye. This Brute came in to Bry∣tayne aboute the .xviij. yere of Hely.


B
E it knowen that in y
e
 noble cite of grete Troy there was a noble knyght and a man of grete power that was called Eneas. And whan y
e
 cite of Troy was lost & destroyed through them of Grece. This Eneas with all his meyny fledde thens & came in to Lombardy. And tho was lorde & gouernour of that londe a kyng that hyght Latyne. And another kynge there was y
e
 hyght Turocelyne that strongly warred vpon this kynge Latyne / y
e
 oftentymes dyd hym moche harme. And whan this kynge Latyne herde y
t
 Eneas was come / he receyued hym with moche honour / & hym with helde for as moche as he had herd of hȳ and wyst well y
t
 he was a noble knight and a worthy of his body & of his dedes This Eneas helped kynge Latyne in his wa
 / & shortly for to tell / so well & so worthely he dyd / that he slewe Turo∣celyne / & dyscomfyted hym & all his peo¦ple. And whan all this was done / kyng Latyne gaue all y
e
 londe that was Tu∣rocelynes to this noble man Eneas i
 maryage with Lauyne his doughter the moost fayrest creature that ony man wyst. And so they lyued togyder in ioye and myrth all the dayes of theyr lyues. ¶ And after Ascanius sone to Eneas wedded a wyfe / and vpon her he gate a sone that was called Siluine. And this Siluyne whan he coude some reason of man vnwytyng his fader and agaynst his wyll acqueynted hym w
t
 a damoy∣sel that was cosyn to Lauyne that was kynge Latynes doughter y
e
 quene that was Eneas wyfe / and brought the da∣moysell with chylde. And whan Asca∣nius his fader it wyst / anone let enquy∣re of the wysest maysters and of the gre¦test clerkes what chylde the damoysell sholde brynge forth. And they answered and sayd / that she sholde brynge forth a sone that shold kyll bothe his fader and his moder. And so he dyd. For his mo∣der dyed in berynge of hym. And whan this chylde was borne his fader let call hym Brute. And y
e
 maysters sayd that he sholde do moche harme and sorowe in many dyuerse places / and after he sholde come to grete honour and wor∣shyp. This kyng Ascanius dyed whan god wolde / and Siluyne his sone recey¦ued the londe / and made hym wonder
∣ly well beloued among his people. And so whā Brute that was Siluynes sone was .xv. yere olde he went vpon a daye with his fader for to playe & solace. And as Brute shold haue shotte vnto an hart his arowe myshapped & glanced / and so there Brute slewe his fader.






¶ How Brute was dryuen out of the londe / & how he helde hym in Grece.



ANd whan this mischaūce was befallen / all y
e
 people of the londe made grete sorowe / and were sore dys∣pleased. And bycause therof they droue Brute out of y
e
 londe / & wolde not suffre hym amonge them. And whan he sawe that he might not abyde there / he went from thens in to Grece / & there he foūde vij. thousande men that were of y
e
 kyn∣rede of Troye / and were comen of grete blode as the story telleth / as of men and women & children / the whiche were all holden in thraldome & bondage of kyng Pandras of Grece / for y
e
 deth of Achyl∣les that was betrayed & slayne at Troy This Brute was a wōders fayre man and a stronge & huge of his age / and of gladde chere & semblaūt / & also worthy of body / & was well beloued amōge his people. This kyng Pandras herde spe∣ke of his goodnes & condicyons / & anone made hym to dwell with hym. So that Brute became wonders preuy & moche beloued with y
e
 kynge / & dwelled longe tyme with the kynge. So at y
e
 last they of Troy & Brute spake togyder of kyn∣rede & lygnage & of acqueyntaūce / and there complayned them vnto Brute of theyr sorowe & of theyr bondage / and of many other shames y
e
 kynge Pandras had done to them / & to Brute they sayd vpon a tyme. Ye be a lord of our lignage & a stronge man & a myghty / be ye our capytayne & gouernour / & we wyll be∣come your men / & fulfyll al your cōmaū dementes / & brynge vs out of this wret chednes & bondage / & we wyll fyght w
t
 the kyng for trouth / with the grace of y
e
 grete god we shall ouercome hym & we shall make you kynge of this londe / & to you do homage / & of you we shall holde for euermore. Brute had tho grete pyte of theyr bondage y
t
 they were brought in / & pryuely went fro y
e
 kynges courte / and tho that were of Troy went & put them in to woodes & in to moūtaynes / & helde them there / and sente vnto kynge Pandras that he sholde gyue them ly∣cence for to departe safely out of his lōde and kyngdom / for they wolde no longer dwell in his bondage. Whan kyng Pan¦dras herde this / he was sore vexed and anoyed / & tho sware that he wolde 
e them euerychone / and ordeyned a grete power / and went towardes them for to fyght with them. But Brute and his men manly them defended and fyersly fought / & slewe all the kynges men that none of them escaped / and toke y
e
 kynge and put hym in pryson / and ordeyned a coūseyle amonge them selfe what they myght do w
t
 the kynge. And some sayd that he sholde be put to deth / and some sayd that he sholde be exyled out of the londe / & some sayd y
t
 he sholde be brent. And than spake a wyse knyght y
t
 was called Mempris & sayd to Brute & to all them of Troy. Yf kyng Pandras wolde yelde hym & haue his lyfe / I coūseyle y
t
 he gyue vnto Brute (that is our duke & our souerayn) his doughter Ge
og
 to wyfe / & in maryage with her an hon¦dred shyppes well arayed / & all his trea¦sour of golde & syluer / of corne & of wyne and as moche as we nede of one thynge & other / & than go we out of this londe and ordeyne vs a lōde els where / for we nor none of our kynrede y
t
 come after vs shall neuer haue peas in this londe a∣monge them of Grece / for we haue 
ay∣ne so many of theyr knyghtes & of other frendes that euermore warre & dyscord shall be amonge vs. Brute tho & all his folke consented gladly to y
e
 coūseyle / and this thȳge they tolde to kyng Pandras And he for to haue his lyfe / graūted as moche as they demaunded / and anone gaue vnto Brute the fayre lady Genno∣gen his doughter to wyfe / and an hon∣dred shyppes with as moche as them



 of all vytayles / as afore was or∣deyned. Thā Brute toke his wyfe & all his men that forsoke the londe of Grete & went to the see / & had wynde & weder at theyr wyll / & came the thyrde daye in to an yle that was called Logres. This Brute anone sent of his men to londe for to espye y
e
 maner of y
e
 coūtrce. And they founde an olde cite all wasted & forlet / so that there was neyther man nor womā therin dwellynge. And in the myddle of this cyte they foūde an olde temple of a fayre lady that was called Diane the goddesse. And they came agayne vnto Brute & tolde hym what they had seen & foūde / & they coūseyled hym to go & do sacrifyce vnto dame Diane / for she was wont to gyue answere of what thynge that mē asked her / & namely vnto them that honour her with sacryfyce. Brute wente vnto y
t
 ymage & sayd. Diane no∣ble goddesse that all thynge hast in thy myght / wyndes / waters / woodes / fel∣des / & all thynges of y
e
 worlde / & all ma∣ner of beestes that ben therin / vnto you I make my prayer / that ye coūseyle me and tell / where & in what plāce I shall haue a cōuenyent place to dwell in with my folke. And there I shall make in the honour of the a fayre temple & a noble / wherin ye shall alwaye be honoured. Whan he had done his prayer / Diane answered in this maner. Brute sayd she go euen forth thy way ouet the see in to fraūce towarde the west / & there ye shal fynde an yle that is called Albion / & that yle is becompassed all with the see / & no man may come therin but it be by shyp∣pes / & in that londe were wont to dwell gyauntes / but now it is not so / but all wyldernes / & that londe is destenyed & ordeyned for you & for your people.






¶ How Coryn became Brutes man / & how kynge Goffar was discomfyted.


ANd whan Brute had this an∣swere of Diane the goddesse / a∣none he let wȳde vp the ancres & sayled in to the hye see. And whā he & his men had sayled .xx. dayes & more / they foūde fall besyde a coost of the see a. M. men of the kynrede of Troy / & theyr souerayne mayster was called Coryn. And whan Brute wyst whens they were / he toke them w
t
 moche ioye in to his shyppes / & so he ladde them forth with hym. This Coryn there became Brutes man / & to hȳ dyd homage. And so lōge they sayled forth in the see tyll they came in to Gas∣coyne / & anone they arryued in y
e
 hauen of Lyegers / & there they dwelled .viij. dayes for to rest them / and to amende theyr sayles there as they had nede. Ty dynges soone came to kyng Goffar that was 
lord
 of that londe how that moche people of straunge londe were arryued in to his londe in the hauen of Lyegers wherfore he was sore angred & anoyed that they came and arriued in his londe without his lycence & his leue. And a∣none ordeyned hym a grete power for to dryue out Brute & to destroye hym & all his people. But it was so y
e
 kynge Gof∣far was dyscomfyted & all his people / & hymselfe fledde in to fraunce for to haue helpe & socour. And in y
t
 tyme regned in fraunce .xij. kynges / and .xj. of them as∣sembled a grete power for to belpe Gof∣far / & for to fyght agaynst Brute. This Goffar dwelled w
t
 the kynges of fraūce halfe a yere & more. And in the meane tyme that Goffar was in fraūce / Brute & his company destroyed all the londe of Gascoyne / and let take all the treasour that kynge Goffar had / & made it to be brought in to his shyppes. ¶ And this Brute foūde in that londe a fayre place and a conueny ent / & there he let make a fayre castell and a stronge. Whan this was all done / kynge Goffar came from


fraunce and .xj. kynges with hym / and brought w
t
 hym .xx. M. men for to fyght with Brute & his company. And Brute had but .vij. M. and .iij. C. men / & neuer theles whan y
e
 two hoostes mette togy∣der / Brutes folke through helpe of hym selfe & of Turyn his cosyn & of Coryn / y
•
 well & manly him defended / so y
•
 within a whyle they had slayne of y
•
 frenshmen moo than two. M. Anone all tho y
•
 were alyue fledde away. And in this batayle Turin Brutes cosyn was slayne / & Bru¦te let bury hym worthely whan he had space in y
e
 castell y
t
 he had made / & tho let call y
t
 same castell Tours / for bycause of the name of Turin y
t
 there was buryed And yet vnto this daye there is a noble cite y
t
 is called Tours. And whan kyng Goffar wyst y
t
 Turyn was deed / he ca∣me agayne w
t
 his men & gaue a stronge batayle to Brute. But Brute & his men were so wery for fightȳge y
t
 they might no longer endure / & than went in to his castel w
t
 all his men: & made y
•
 gates fast for to saue them / & toke coūseyle amōge them what they sholde do. Brute & Co∣ryn gaue coūseyle & ordeyned pryuely y
•
 Coryn shold go out and busshe hym in a wode tyll on y

 morowe / so y
t
 in the mor∣nynge whan Brute sholde fyght w
t
 his enemyes / Coryn shold come w
t
 his folke on y
e
 one syde & slee & do all y
e
 harme y
t
 he myght. And on the morowe at the daw∣nynge of y
•
 daye Brute wente out of the castel & fought fyersly w
t
 his enemyes / & they manly defended them. But within a lytell tyme Brūte & his men slewe. viij hondred of kynge Goffers men / & than came Corin w
t
 the busshemēt / & he & his company smote to the groūde all those y
•
 wolde stande or abyde / so y
e
 kynge Gof∣far & his company were discomfyted / & fast they began to flec. And Brute & Co∣ryn with theyr company fyersly them pursued / and slewe moo of them in the fleynge than they dyd in y

 batayle. And in this maner Brute had y
•
 victory / ne∣uertheles Brute made moche sorow for his cosyn Turyn that there was slayne & other also that he had lost of his men / that is to saye .vij. hondred and .xv. the whiche nobly he buryed in the same ca∣stell of Tours / there where that he had buryed Turyn his cosyn.

Nd whā all this was done Brute wold no longer dwell there for to fyght & lose his men. For kyng Goffers peo¦ple myght euery day encrease moo and moo / & Brutes men lessed / & therfore he toke all his men & wente vnto the see / & had wynde & weder at theyr wyll. And the fyfth daye after they arryued in an hauen at Cornes / & came in to this re∣alme y
t
 than was called Albyon / where they founde neyther man nor woman / saue grete gyauntes / & they dwelled in mountaynes & in cauernes. And Brute


sawe the londe was fayre and at his ly kynge / and was good also for hym & for all his people / as Diane y
e
 goddesse had behyght hym. And therof was Brute wonders gladde / and let assemble vpon a daye all his folke to make a solempne sacrifyce and a grete feest in y
e
 honour & reuerēce of Diane the goddesse / whiche had coūseyled hȳ fyrst to come in to this londe. And whā they had done theyr so∣lē pnite / as they sate at theyr meet vpon a daye there came in vpon them .xxx. gy¦auntes / and slewe .xxx. of Brutes men. Brute & his mē anone stert vp & fought with the gyauntes / & slewe them eue∣rychone / saue one y
t
 was called Gogma¦gog / & he was mayster of all y
•
 gyaūtes & he was strōger & hyer than ony of the other / & Brute kepte hym for to wrastle with Corin his man / for he was greter and hyer than 
ny of Brutes men from the gyrdelstede vpwarde. Gogmagog & Corin vndertoke there for to wrastle / & so togyder they went / & wrastled a lōge tyme / but at the last Gogmagog helde Coryn so fast y
t
 he brake two rybbes in his syde / wherfore Coryn was sore an∣gry / & there he toke Gogmagog bytwe∣ne his armes & cast hym downe vpon a roche / soo that Gogmagog brake all to peces / & so he dyed an euyll deth / & ther∣fore the place is called yet vnto this day the saute of Gogmagog. And thā after Brute gaue all that coūtree vnto Corin And than Corin called it after his name Cornewayle / & his men ben called Cor∣newayles / & so sholde men of that coun∣tree be called for euermore. And in that countree dwelled Corin & his men / and they made townes and houses / & euha∣byted that londe by theyr owne wyll.






¶ How Brute buylded London / & cal∣led this londe Brytayn / and Scotlonde Albanye / and Wales Cambar.




¶ London.




B
Rute & his men wente forth and sawe aboute in dyuerse places where y
t
 they myght fynde a good place and coue∣nable that they myght buylde and ma∣ke a cyte on / for hym and for his folke. And so at the last they came by a fayre ryuer / whiche now is called Temmes / and there Brute began to buylde a fay∣re cyte / and called it newe Troye / in re∣membraunce of grete Troye / from the whiche place all theyr lygnage was co¦men. And this Brute let fell downe wo∣des / & let ere & sowe londes / & let mawe down medowes for y
e
 sustenaūce of hȳ & his people. And thā he departed y
e
 londe to them / so y
t
 eche of them had a parte & place to dwell in. And thā Brute let call all this londe Brytayne after his name and his folke Brytons. And this Brute had gotē on his wyfe Gennogen .iij. so∣nes y
t
 were worthy of dedes / y
e
 first was called Lotryn / y
e
 seconde Albanak / & the


thyrde Cambar / & Brute bare crowne in the cite of newe Troy .xx. yere after y
•
 tyme that y
e
 cyte was made. And there he made the lawes y
t
 the Britons holde And this Brute was wondersly well be ioued amonge all his people. And Bru∣tes sones also loued wondersly well to∣gyder. And whan Brute had sought all the londe in length & brede / he founde a londe y
t
 ioyned to Brytayne in the north And that londe Brute gaue to Albanak his sone / & let call it Albanye after his name / y
t
 now is called Scotlonde. And Brute foūde an other countree to warde the west / and gaue that to Cambar his other sone / & let call it Cambar after his name / and now it is called Wales. And whan Brute had regned .xx. yere / than he dyed in the cite of newe Troye.






¶ How Lotryn that was Brutes sone entred with moche honour / and gouer∣ned the londe well and worthely.


AFter Brute regned Lotryn his sone / that was y
e
 seconde kynge in Brytayn. And he began to regne the seconde yere of Samuel. This Lotryn was crowned kyng w
t
 grete solempnite of all Brytayne: And after whā he was crowned kyng / Albanak & Cambar his bretherne departed in to theyr owne coū¦trees / & there they lyued with moche ho¦nour and worshyp. And Lotryn regned well & wysely / & was moche beloued of his people. And it befell so y
t
 as Albanak dwelled in his his owne londe w
t
 moche ho∣nour & worship / there came kyng Hum bar of Hunlonde with a grete power / & 
ryued in Albanye / & wold haue cōque¦
 the londe / and began to warre vpon Albanak / slowe hȳ in batayle. Whan Albanak was deed / the people of y
e
 lōde fledde vnto Lotryn & tolde him bycause he was kynge of Brytayne how y
t
 his broder was slayne / & prayed hym of his helpe & socour for to auenge his broders deth. Lotryn thā anone let assemble all the Brytons of Kent / of Douer vnto de∣rewent / of Norfolke & Suffolke / of Keft fen & Lyndessey. And whan they were assembled / they sped them fast towarde theyr enemyes for to gyue them batayle And Lotryn had sente to Cambar his broder y
t
 he sholde come vnto hym with all y
e
 power that he myght make / for to helpe hym to auenge his broders deth. And so he dyd with a good wyll. Whan they came togider they toke theyr waye pryuely for to go seke kynge Humbar where they myght fynde hym. And so it befell that this kynge Humbar was besyde a water that was a grete ryuer with his folke for to dysporte hym. And there came Lotryn & Cambar his bro∣der with all theyr folke sodeynly or that ony of theyr enemyes wyst. And whan Humbar sawe them come / he was sore adrad / for as moche as his men wyst 
 not afore / and also they were vnarmed. And anone Humbar for drede 
 in to the water and drowned hymselfe / and so he dyed / and his men were all flayne in so moche that there escaped not one awaye on lyue. And therfore is that wa¦ter called Humbar / and euermore shall be as longe as the worlde standeth / for bycause that this kynge Humbar was drowned therin. And after that Locryn went to his shyppes & toke there golde and syluer as moche as he founde vnto himselfe / & all that other pylfre be gaue vnto other folke of his hoost. And they founde in one of the shyppes a fayre da∣moyfell whiche was kynge Humbars doughter / and she was called Estrylde. And whan kynge Lotryn sawe her / he toke her with hym bycause of the grete beaute and fayrnes that he sawe in her And for her he was ouertaken in loue / 


and wolde haue wedded her. These ty∣dynges came to Corin: & anone thought to auenge hym on Lotryn / for as moche as Lotryn had promised hym to wedde Guentolyn his doughter. And Corin in haste toke his waye to newe Troy vnto hym / & sayd thus to Lotryn. Certes ye rewarde me full euyll for y
e
 paynes that I haue had for your fader Brute / wher fore syth it is so I wyll auenge me now on the. And with y
t
 drewe his swerde & wolde haue slayne Lotryn y
e
 kyng. But the damoysel went bytwene them / and made them to be accorded in this maner that Lotryn sholde take Guentolyn Co∣rins doughter to wyfe. And so Lotryn dyd. Neuertheles after he was maryed he wente pryuely to Estrylde & gate on her a doughter that was called Abram And it befell so y
t
 anone after Corin dyed & after whan he was deed / Lotryn for∣soke Guentolyn that was his wyfe / & made Es
 quene. And than Guen∣tolyn dep
 frō the
s 
 grete wrath in to Cori
e / & there seased all the londe in to her owne ha
ors / for as mo∣che as she was her faders heyre / & toke homage of all y
•
 men of y
•
 londe. And af∣terwarde she assembled a grete hoost & a myghty of men for to be auenged vpon Lottyn y
•
 was her lorde / & gaue hym a stronge but a yle / where Lotryn her hus¦bonde was slayne / & his men discōfyted in the .v. yere of his regne. Guētolyn let take Estrylde & Abram her doughter / & bounde them bothe handes & fete & cast them bothe in to a water / & so they were dro
ed / wherfore y
•
 water was euer∣more after called Abram / after y
•
 name of y
•
 damoysell y
•
 was Est
yldes dough∣ter / & englysshe men call that water Se¦uerine / & walshmen call it Abram yet vn to this daye. And whan this was done Gu
ol yn let crowne her quene of all y
•
 londe. And she gouerned the londe well and wysely vnto th
ty me that 
 her sone that Lotryn had goten 
 was .xx. yere of age / that he myght be kyng. And so the quene reg
d .xv. yere And than let she crowne her sone kyng / and he regned and gouerned the 
 well & worthtly. And his moder went in to Cornewayle / and there she dwelled all the dayes of her lyfe.

t
 his doughter of hym & of his company was wery / & her lord & she of hym had grete scorne & despyte / so that frō .xxx. knyghtes they brought vnto .x. and afterwarde had he but .v. & so they left hym no moo. Than made he grete sorowe / & sayd sore wepyng. Alas that euer I came in to this londe & sayd yet had it ben better to haue dwelled w

 this sorowe & myschefe is to me now fallen. For now am I poore y
t
 somtyme was ryche / but now haue I no frende ne kyn that to me wyll do ony good. But whā I was ryche all mē me honoured & wor¦shypped / & now euery man hath of me scorne & despite / & now I wote wel that Cordeil my yōgest doughter said trouth whā she sayd / as moche as I had so mo¦che sholde I be loued / & all y

 londe / so y
•
 bytwene them they ordeyned a grete power / and strongly warred on her / & neuer rested tyll they had taken her & put her to deth And than Morgan & Conedag seased al the londe & departed it bytwene them / & they held it .xij. yere / & whan y

 they warred strongly togyder / & dyd to eche other moche dys∣ease / for Morgan 
wold
 haue all y

•
 Conedag helde. But he came agaynst hym w
t
 a stronge power: so y

 Morgan durst not abyde but fledde away in to Wales / and Conedag pursued hym / & toke hym & slewe hym. And than Conedag came & seased al the londe in to his handes & helde it / & reg∣ned after .xxxiij. yere / & than he dyed / & lyeth at newe Troy.

AFter this Conedag regned Rey∣nold his sone y

 was a wyse & an hardy knyght & curteys / y
•
 well & nobly ruled y

¶ How Gorbodian had .ij. sones / & how the one slewe y
•
 other for to haue y
•
 londe / & how ydoyne theyr moder slew y
•
 other wherfore the londe was destroyed.


WHan this Gorbodian was deed his two sones y
•
 he had became stoute & proude / & euer warred togyder for the londe / & y
•
 one was called Ferres & y
•
 other Porres. And this Ferres wol∣de haue all y
•
 londe / but that other wold not suffre hym. This Ferres had a fe∣lonous hert: & thought through treason to slee his broder / but pryuely he wente in to fraūce / & there abode w
t
 the kynge Syward / tyll vpon a tyme whan he ca¦me agayn to fyght w

of that one sone / she murdred that other / and so lost them bothe.






¶ How foure kynges curteysly helde all Brytayne / and what be theyr na∣mes ye shall here after.






WHan the two brethern were deed they ne had lefte behynde them neyther sone ne doughter ne none other of the kynrede y
t
 might enheryte y
•
 londe And for as moche as the strongest men droue & discomfyted the feblest & toke all theyr londes / so y
t
 in euery coūtree they had grete warre and stryfe vnder them But amōge all other thȳges there were foure in the coūtree that ouercame all y
•
 other / & through theyr myght & strēgth they toke all the londes / & euery of them toke a certayne coūtree / & in his coūtree let call hym kynge / & one of them was called Scater / & he was called kynge of Scotlonde / & that other was called Da walier / & he was kynge of Logres / & of all the londe that was Lotryns y
t
 was Brutes sone. The thyrde was called Ru dac / & he was kynge of Wales. And the fourth was called Cloten / & he was kȳg of Cornewayle. But this Cloten sholde haue had all the londe by right / bycause there was no man y
•
 wyst none so ryght heyre as he was. But they that were strongest set lytel by them y
•
 were of lesse estate / & therfore this Clotē had no more londe amonge them but Cornewayle.






¶ Of kynge Donebant that was Clo∣tens sone / & how he wanne the londe.


THis Cloten had a sone that was called Donebāt / y
•
 after the deth of his fader became an hardy man and a fayre & a curteys / so y
•
 he passed all the other kȳges of fayrnes & of worthynes. And anone as he was knyght he wyst wel that whan his fader lyued he was moost ryghtfull heyre of all y
•
 londe / and sholde haue had it by ryght / but y
•
 other kynges y
•
 were of moche more strength than he toke frō hym y
•
 londe. Wherfore this Donebant ordeyned hym a grete power / & conquered fyrst the londe of Lo¦gres / and after he went to conquere all the londe of Scotlonde and Wales. And Scater came w
t
 his men & gaue him ba¦tayle / & Rudac came also w
t
 his walshe men for to helpe hȳ / but so it befell y
•
 Ru∣dac was slayne & Scater also in playne batayle. And so Donebāt had y
•
 vyctory & conquered all the londe / & well mayn∣tayned it in peas and in quyete / that ne∣uer before it was so well mayntayned.






¶ How Donebāt was the fyrst kyng y
•
 euer bare crowne of golde in Brytayne.


THis Donebant let make hym a crowne of gold / & ware y
e
 crowne vpon his heed as neuer kyng did before & he ordeyned a statute / y
t
 yfa man had done neuer so moche harme and myght come in to the Temple / there sholde no man hym mysdo / but go there in safete and in peas / & after go in to what londe or countree that hym pleased / without ony harme / and yf ony man had set ony


hande vpon hym / he than 
shold
 lese his lyfe. And this Donebant made y
•
 towne of Malmesbury / & y
•
 towne also of y
•
 vise And whā he had regned well & worthe∣ly .xl. yere he dyed & lyeth at new Troy.






¶ How Brenne & Belyn departed bytwene them the londe after the deth of Donebant theyr fader. And of the warre bytwene them.


ANd after y
•
 this Donebant was deed his sones departed y
•
 londe bytwene them as theyr fader had ordey¦ned / so y
•
 Belyn his eldest sone had all y
•
 londe of Brytayn from Humbar south∣warde / & his broder Brenne had all the londe from Humbar to Scotlonde. But for as moche as Belin had y
•
 better part Brenne therfore waxed wroth & wolde haue had more of the londe: & Belyn his broder wolde graūte hȳ no more / wher∣fore stryfe & warre arose bytwene them two. But Brenne y
•
 yōger broder had no myght ne strength agaynst Belyn / and therfore Brenne through coūseyll of his folke went fro thens in to Norwey to y
•
 kyng Olsynges / & prayed hym of helpe & so
our for to conquere all y
•
 londe vpon Belyn his broder / vpon y
•
 couenaūt y
t
 he wolde haue his doughter to wyfe. And kyng Olsynges hȳ graūted. And Belin anone as his broder was gone to Nor∣wey he seased in to his hādes all y
•
 londe of Northumberlond / & toke all y
•
 castels & let them be arayed / & kept y
•
 coostes of the see y
•
 Brenne sholde not arryue on no syde but y
•
 he were taken. Kyng Olsyn∣ges let assemble a grete hoost / & delyue∣red his doughter to Brēne & all y
•
 people that he had ordeyned. This damoysell Samye had longe tyme loued a kyng y
•
 was called Gutlagh / & to hym she tolde all her coūseyle / & how y
•
 Brenne sholde haue her & lede her with hym for euer∣more / & so he sholde lese her but that she myght forsake Brenne. And whā Gut∣lagh had herde these tydynges / he laye for to espye Brenne w
t
 as many shippes as he myght make & haue. So the two fletes mette togyder / & longe tyme they fought / so that Brenne & his men were dyscomfyted. And kynge Gutlagh toke Samye & put her in to his shyppe. And Brenne shamefully fled thens as a man discomfyted. And this kynge Gutlagh wolde haue gone in to his owne toū
tre but there came vpon hȳ so grete a 
st that lasted .v. dayes / so y
•
 through y
•
 
 pest he was dryuen in to Brytayn with thre shyppes & no moo. And tho y
•
 kepte the coostes of y
•
 see toke Gutlagh & Sa∣mye & all his folke / & them presented to Belyn. And Belyn put them in pryson.






¶ How Belyn let departe out of his londe kynge Gutlagh of Denmarke and Samye.


 I was not longe after y
•
 Brenne came agayn with a grete nauy & sente to his broder Belyn that he sholde yelde agayn his londe to his wyfe & his folke / & his castles also / or els be worde destroye his londe. Belyn drad noth
ge his malyce / & wolde no thynge do 
 that he had sayd. Wherfore Brenne ca∣me with his folke & fought w
t
 B
 & Brenne was discomfyted and his folke slayne / & hymselfe fledde with. 
. men in to fraūce. And this Belyn that was Brennes broder went than to Yorke / & toke coūseyle what he myght do with kyng Gutlagh / for kyng Gutlagh pro∣fered to become his man / & to holde his londe of hym / yeldynge yerely a thou∣sande poūde of syluer for euermore / and for sykernes of this couenaunt to be hol den / Gutlagh sholde brynge hym good hostages / & to hym sholde do homage &


all his folke / & yet he sholde swere vpon a boke y
•
 it sholde neuer be broken ne fay¦led. ¶ Belyn tho by coūseyle of his folke graūted hym his askyng / & so Gutlagh became his man. And Belyn toke of hȳ his homage by an othe / & by wrytynge the same couenauntes. And vpon these couenaūtes kynge Guthlagh toke Sa∣mie & his folke & went thens & returned agayne to Denmarke. Euermore after were the couenaūtes holden & y
•
 truage payed / tyll the tyme that Hon
lus was kyng of Denmarke & also of this londe through his wyfe Gildeburgh y
•
 he had spoused / for she was right heyre of this londe. This Belyn dwelled tho in peas & worshypfully hym helde amonge his barōs. And he made foure ryall wayes one from y
•
 eest vnto y
•
 west / & that was called watlyng strete / & an other from y
•
 north vnto the south / & that was called Ikelme strete / and two other wayes he made in bossyng through out y
•
 londe / y
•
 one is called Fosse / and that other Fosse dyke. And he maynteyned well y
•
 good lawes y
•
 Donebāt his fader had made & ordeyned in his tyme / as before is sayd.






¶ How accordmēt was made bytwene Brenne and Belyn through Cornewen that was theyr moder.


BRenne that was Belyns broder had longe time dwelled in fraūce & there had conquered a grete lordshyp through maryage. For he was duke of Burgoyne through y
•
 doughter of duke Fewyn y
•
 he had spoused / whiche was right heyre of y
•
 londe. And this Brenne ordeyned a grete power of his folke and also of fraūce / & came in to this londe for to fight w
t
 Belyn his broder. And Belyn came agaynst hym w
t
 a grete power of brytons / & wolde haue gyuen hym ba∣tayle. But whā theyr moder Cornewen that thā lyued had herde that y
•
 one bro¦der 
wold
 haue destroyed that other / she went bytwene her sones / & made them accorde w
t
 moche payne. So y
•
 at the last the two bretherne w
t
 moche blysse went togyder in to new Troy / y
•
 now is called Londō / where they dwelled a yere / & af¦ter they toke theyr counseyle for to go & cōquere all fraūce / & so they dyd / & brent townes & destroyed the londe in lengthe & brede / & the kyng of fraūce gaue them batayle w
t
 his power / but he was ouer comen / & gaue truage to Belyn & to his broder. And after y
•
 they went forth vn∣to Rome / & cōquered it & all Lombardy and Germany / & toke homage of all the chefe lordes & barons. And after they ca¦me in to this londe of Brytayn / & dwel∣led with theyr brytōs in ioye & rest. And than made Brenne y
•
 towne of Brystow and after he went ouer to his owne lord ship / & there dwelled he all his lyfe. And Belyn dwelled at newe Troye / & there he made a fayre gate that is called Be∣lynges gate after his owne name. And whan this Belyn had regned nobly. x
. yere he dyed / & lyeth at newe Troye.






¶ How kynge Cormbatrus slewe the kyng of Denmarke / for bycause that he wolde not paye to hym his truage.







ANd after this Belyn regned his sone Cormbatrus a good man & a worthy. And the kyng of Denmarke wolde not paye to hym his truage / y
•
 is to say / a. M. poūde as he had sworne by othe for to paye it / & also by wrytyng re∣corde to Belyn his fader / wherfore he was euylapayed & wroth / & assembled a grete hoost of brytons and went in to Denmarke / & slewe y
•
 kyng Gutlagh / & brought y
•
 londe in subieccyō all newe / & toke of y
•
 folke feaute & homage / & after went agayne in to his owne londe / & as he came forth by Orkeney he foūde. xxx shyppes ful of men & women besyde the coost of y
•
 see / & y
•
 kyng asked what they were. And an erle that was mayster of them all curteysly answered to y
•
 kynge & sayd y
t
 they were exiled out of spayne / & so y
t
 they had trauayled halfe a yere & more in the see / to wyte yf they myght fynde ony kynge in ony londe y
•
 of them wolde haue pite or mercy to gyue them ony londe in ony countree / wherin they myght dwell & haue rest / & become his lyege men / & to hym wold do homage & feaute whyle they lyued & to his heyres after hym / & of hȳ & of his heyres holde that londe. And whan y
•
 kyng herd this he had pite on them / & gaue them an yle all wyldernes / where no mā was dwel¦lynge / saue onely wylde beestes. And y
•
 erle thāked moche y
•
 kyng & became his man / & dyd hym homage & feaute / & to∣ke all his folke & went in to the same yle And y
•
 erle was called Irlamal / & ther∣fore he let call y

 londe Irlonde after his name. This kyng Cormbatrus came a∣gayn in to his londe & regned .xxv. yere / & after dyed / & lyeth at newe Troye.

t
 he was euer gracyous to his subiectes and poore men. And he had peas al his dayes / & all people that sayd agaynst christē folke / without ony mercy he destroyed. And he exiled Py∣late for euer. Than he decessed & a worse succeded hym. ¶ After Eusebe it is wry¦ten / that our lord at .xxx. yere of his age chose his .xij. apostles / the whiche ma∣de our Crede / that is our byleue / & they made it after the resurreccyon of Chryst and after the holy ghoost was sent vnto them / whan they had chosen Mathia y

 Ascencyon & whytsondaye / in the place of Iudas scaryot y

And whan that chylde was borne & called Iudas / his fader & his moder abhorred as well to slee theyr chylde / as to nourysshe a tray∣tour to the kynge & all his people / ther∣fore they put hym in to a panyer or leep in to the see. And he flowed to the yle of Scaryoth / where the lady of that place had no chyldren by her husbonde / & she feyned her to be w

cursed man draweth to another / ther∣fore he drewe to Pylate / & stode gretely in his fauour. And vpon a certayn daye whan Pylate loked out of his palays in to an orcharde of a mānes that was cal¦led Ruben the whiche was very fader to Iudas / Pylate desyred to haue ap∣ples / and Iudas went to gader apples and Ruben ranne to Iudas for to let hȳ bycause he toke his apples without ony leue. And after y

 they had chydden this Iudas smote his fader on the heed w

 Ruben died sodeynly. Thā Pilate gaue Iudas all Rubens goodes & his wyfe Ciborea y

¶ Of kyng Gynder that was Kym∣balyns sone / that wolde not paye the truage to Rome for the londe y
t
 Cassi∣balon had graūted / and how he was slayne of a Romayne.


ANd after the deth of this Kym∣balyn regned Gynder his sone a good man and a worthy / & was of so hygh herte that he wolde not paye to Rome the trybute that kynge Cassyba∣lon had graunted vnto Iulius Cesar / wherfore the emperour that was than that was Claudius Cesar / was sore a∣noyed and greued / and ordeyned a grete power of Romayns / and came in to this londe for to conquere y

 trybute through myght and strengthe / and for to haue it on the kynge. But this kynge Gynder and Armager his broder assembled and


gadered a grete hoost togyder of Britōs and gaue batayle to y
e
 emperour Clau∣dius / & slewe of y

 Romayns grete plen∣te. The emperour had afterward one y

 was called Hamon y
•
 sawe theyr people were there fast slayne / & pryuely cast a∣waye his owne armes / & toke y
•
 armes of a deed bryton & armed hym therwith and came in to the batayle to y
e
 kynge / & thus he sayd. Syr be of a good herte for goddes loue / for the Romayns your ene∣myes anone shall be slayne & discōfyted. And the kyng gaue no kepe to his wor∣des / for bycause of y
e
 armes that he had vpon hym / & wend it had ben a Bryton But the traytour euer helde hym nexte the kynge / & pryuely vnder y
e
 sholder of his arme he smote the kynge / wherfore the kynge dyed & fell downe to the erth. Whā Armager sawe his broder so deed he cast awaye his armes & toke to hym his broders armes / & came in to the ba∣tayle amonge y
e
 brytons / & badde them hertely for to fyght & fast lay downe the Romayns. And for y
e
 armes they wende it had ben kyng Gynder that afore was slayne y
t
 they wyst not. Than began the Brytons fyersly to fyght / & slewe the Ro¦mayns. So at y
e
 last y
e
 emperour for soke the felde & fledde as fast as he myght w
t
 his folke in to Wynchestre. And the fals traytour Hamon y
t
 had slayne the kyng fast anone began to flee with all y
e
 haste that he might. And Armager y
e
 kynges broder pursued hym full fyersly with a fyers herte / & droue hym vnto a water and there he toke hym / & anone smote of bothe handes & feet & heed / & hewed the body all to peces / & than let cast hym in to the water / wherfore that water was called Hamons hauen. And afterwarde there was made a fayre towne that yet standeth y
t
 is called Southamton. And afterward Armager went to Wynche∣ster to seke Claudius y
e
 Emperour / and there toke hym. And Claudius y
e
 empe∣rour through coūseyle of his Romayns that were lefte alyue made peas w
t
 Ar∣mager in this maner folowyng / that is to saye / that Claudius sholde gyue vnto Armager Gennen his doughter to wyfe & that this londe fro that tyme forward shold be in y
e
 emperours power of Rome takyng none other tribute but homage. And they were accorded. And vpon this couenaūt Claudius cesar sente to Rome for his doughter Gennen. And whā she was comē Claudius gaue her to Arma¦ger to wyfe. And Armager spoused her at London w
t
 grete solem
nite. And thā he was crowned kynge of Brytayne.






¶ Of kynge Armager in whose tyme saynt Peter preched in Antioche with other apostles in dyuers coūtrees.


THis Armager regned well and worthely & gouerned well y
e
 lōde And Claudius cesar in remembraūce of this accorde / & for reuerence & honour of his doughter made in this londe a fa
e towne & castell / & let call the towne after his name Claucestren / y
e
 new is called Glocestre. And whā this was all done y
e
 emperour toke his l

t
 was called Westmer. And whyle 
 Armager regned saint Peter preched in Antioche / & there he made a noble chir∣che / in y
e
 whiche he sate fyrst in his chay¦re / & there he dwelled .vij. yere. And af∣ter he went to Rome & was made pope tyll y
t
 Nero y
e
 emperour let martyr hym And than preched openly all y

 apostles in dyuers londes the true faythe. And whan Armager had regned .xxiiij. yere he dyed / and lyeth at London.






¶ How kyng Westmer gaue to Beryn∣ger an ylonde forlet / & there this Beryn¦ger made the towne of Berwyk.



ANd after this A
ager regned his sone Westmer / that was a good man and a worthy of body / & well gouerned the londe. It befell so that ty∣dynges came to hym on a daye that the kynge Roderyk of Gascoyne was come in to this londe with an huge hoost of people / and was dwellynge in Stanes∣more. And whan kyng Westmer herde those tydynges / he let assemble an huge hoost of Brytons / and came to kyng Ro¦deryk & gaue hym batayle. And kynge Westmer slewe Roderik with his owne handes in playne batayle. And whan kynge Roderykes men sawe that theyr lord was slayne / they yelded them all to kynge Westmer / & became his men for euermore. And he gaue them a coūtre y
t
 was forlet wherin they myght dwell / & thyder they went / and dwelled there all theyr lyfe tyme / & .ix .C. men there were of them / & no moo lefte at that batayle. Theyr gouernour & prynce was called Beringer / & anone he began a towne y
t
 they myght therin dwell & haue resorte & let call y
e
 towne Berwyk vpon Twede And there they enhabyted & became ry∣che. But they had no women amonge them / and the Brytons wolde not gyue theyr doughters to y
e
 straūgers / wher∣fore they went ouer see in to Irlonde / & brought with them women / and there they them spoused. But the men coude not vnderstande theyr language ne spe∣che of these women / & therfore they spa∣ke togyder as scottes. And afterwarde through chaungynge theyr languages in all Fraūce they were than called scot∣tes / and so sholde the folke of that coun∣tre be called for euermore.






¶ How kynge Westmer let arere a stone in y
e
 entrynge of Westmerlōde there as he slewe Roderyk / & there he began fyrst housynge.






ANd after this batayle that is a∣boue sayd / whan Roderyk was slayne / kyng Westmer in remembraūce of his vyctory let arere there besydes y
•
 waye a grete stone on hygh / and yet it standeth / and euermore shal stande / and he let graue in the said stone lettres that thus sayd. The kyng Westmer of Bry∣tayne slewe in this place Roderyk his enemy. And this Westmer was y
e
 fyrst that buylded hous and towne in West∣merlonde / and at that stone begynneth Westmerlonde / that Westmer let call af¦ter his owne name. And whā Westmer had so done / he dwelled all his lyfe tyme in that countre of Westmerlonde / for he loued that countre aboue all other coun∣trees. And whan he had regned .xxv. ye¦re he dyed / and lyeth at Karleyll.






¶ Of kynge Coyll that was kynge Westmers sone / that helde his londe in peas all his lyfe tyme.


COyll Westmers sone was crow∣ned kyng after his fader / and he was a good man & a worthy / & of good cōdityons / & well gouerned his londe / & of all men he had loue and peas. And in his tyme was neuer contacke / debate / nor warre in Brytayne. And he regned


in peas all his lyfe. And whan he had regned .xi. yere he dyed & lyeth at Yorke.


CLaudi{us} was emperour at Rome nexte after Gayus / & he regned xiiij. yere & .viij. dayes. This man came in to grete Britayn now called Englond for to chalenge the trybute whiche they dyd deny to y

 Romayns. And after grete batayles there was bytwene the empe¦rour Claudius & Armager kyng of Bri¦tayn. And after accordement made that this Armager sholde wedde Claudius doughter / and after they two shold euer lyue in peas / in token wherof this Clau¦dius named y

Afore this tyme was many a dyscyple of Peter slayne vnder Nero. ¶ Galba this tyme was emperour / & he regned seuen monethes. This man was made emperour by the power of spayne in the same londe / Nero lyuyng And after the dethe of Nero brought to Rome / & there was slayne of a man that came with whete to Rome. He smote of his heed & bare it to hym that was em∣perour nexte / seynge all his meu / & none of them helpyng hym. ¶ In this man∣nes dayes came the grete Rethorycyen to Rome fro Spayne / & was the fyrst y

¶ Anno domini .lxxxiiij.


Let{us} a martyr was pope .xi. yere This Cletus was a Romayne / & gretly he loued pilgrimages to sayntes sayenge it was more {pro}fyte to y
e
 helth of mannes soule to visyte the place y
e
 saynt Peter was in / than to fast two yere. He cursed all those men lettynge suche pyl∣grimages or coūseylers cōtrary therto. At y
e
 last was martyred by Damacian y
e
 emperour. ¶ Titus soue to Vaspasyan was emperour this tyme / & regned .iij. yere / & he abode styl at Ierusalem after the electyon of his fader / & destroyed the cite / and slewe there (as the story sayth) with batayle & hungre .xi. hōdred thou∣sande iewes / and an hondred thousand he toke / & solde .xxx. for a peny / bycause they solde our lord Iesu Chryst for .xxx. pens / & brought theus all thynge that was precyous / & put them in his hous at Rome / whithe was called Tēplū pa cis. But now is y
e
 place fallen downe for the moost party. And all these precyous iewelles be distrybuted to certayn chir∣ches in Rome. This Citus was so full of vertue that all men loued hym / so fe
 forth that they called hym the moost de∣lectable of men. He was full lyberall to all men / in so moche that he sayd often tymes / that there sholde no maner man goo front an Emperoure with an heuy herte / but he sholde no somwhat of his pe
icyon. He wolde be sory that day in the whiche he had graunted no man


no benefyte. Whan he was deed / euery man y
t
 was in Rome wepte for hym / as that they had lost theyr fader. ¶ Domi∣cian broder to Titus regned after hym xiiij. yere & .v. monethes. Fyrst he was easy / and afterwarde full vnreasonable. For moche of y
e
 senate was destroyed by his malyce / & also moche of his kynrede He began the seconde persecucyon after Nero agaynst chrysten men. In y
t
 whi∣che persecucyon John y
e
 euāgelyst was exiled in to Pathmos after y
e
 emperour had put hȳ in to a tonne of brēnyng oyle & hurte hym not. So this man was not the folower of his fader Vaspasyan / ne his broder Titus / but rather lyke Nero & his kynrede. And for his wycked 
ōdi∣cyons he was slayne in his own palays at Rome in the .xxvij. yere of his age. ¶ Clemēs a martyr was pope .ix. yere / and he succeded Cletus. This Clemens fyrst of saynt Peter (as it is sayd) was ordeyned to be successour to him. And for peryll he wolde Linū & Cletū sholde be popes afore hȳ / lest y
t
 through y
e
 ensam∣ple prelates sholde ordeyne vnder them who someuer they wolde. This man made y
e
 lyfe of martyrs to be wryten by regyons / & he made many bokes. He or∣deyned y
t
 a chylde sholde be cōfyrmed as soone as it myght manerly after it was chrystened. And at y
e
 last he was marty∣red vnder Traian. ¶ Nerua was empe¦rour after Domician one yere & two mo∣nethes. And whā he was chosen he me∣ued y
e
 senate to make a lawe / y
t
 all thȳge whiche Domician cōmaūded to be kept shold be broken. By which meane saynt Iohn y
e
 euangelyst was losed out of his exile & suffred to come agayn to Ephese. This man dyd an other thynge ryght cōmendable / that he assygned so wyse a man as Traian was to gouerne y
e
 peo∣ple after hym. Nota. ¶ Traian{us} hyspa uicus was Emperour .xix. yere. This Traian{us} many men sayd he was y
e
 best amonge all the Emperours / but in one thynge alone he was vicyous / in so mo∣che as he for y
e
 loue of y
e
 
als goddes was aboute to destroye y
e
 chrysten fayth / iud∣gynge in hȳselfe so moost to please god. Some men saye not by hymself / but by other he pursued y
e
 christen fayth / & in y
e
 ende of his lyfe he dyd but fewe to deth. And all his louyng I set at nought. But at saint Gregory meued w
t
 pite wepyng & prayed to our lorde for hym y
t
 he 
wold
 haue mercy vpon hym / & by his prayer haue hym out of hell / in to whiche place he was dampned. And now yf he be sa∣ued or not / a grete alteracyon is amōge doctours. And to vs y

e
 eest parte of y
e
 worlde / Babyl
 Selencia / the veter partes of the y
de. Germayne the seconde after Alexander he helde vnder. In all these thynges so pyteous & so mekely he guyded hym to euery man as a kynge. He was gentyll and to no man vngentyll / the whiche is red of fewe. All the dayes be lyued men sayd he was the moost worthy man in all his empyre. And he thought & sayd euermore y

 a bisshop shold be cōsecrated of thre / & dyuers other thynges. At the

This man meued Traian that he shold withdraw the sentence gyuen agaynst chrysten fol∣ke / wrytyng to hym that they dyd none yll / but that they as vertuous folke rose afore day and worshypped Iesu Chryst theyr god secretly in the nyght. ¶ Eua∣ristus a greke and a martyr was .x. yere and .vij. monthes pope after Anaclet{us}.

e
 holy water sholde be kest in chrysten mennes houses / & that breed to synge with shold be made of clere breed / and that in lytell quantite. At the last he was martyred vnder Adrian that was emperour / and many he cōuerted to y

 fayth of Chryst. ¶ Sixtus a Romayn was pope .x. yere and .iij. monethes. This man ordeyned Sanctus sanctus sanctus.

shold
 not be made of sylke / but of pure lynnen cloth wouen & not dyed / and that a woman sholde not touche the holy vessell of the awter / ne the pall. Al∣so he ordeyned / that yf ony bysshopryke were vacaūt / that no bysshop sholde be receyued in to his benefyce but with the popes lettres. Also that no masse sholde be sayd but vpon an awter / & at the last he was martyred. ¶ Adrian was em∣perour .xxi. yere. This Adrian in many thynges is cōmended / to chrysten men otherwhyle he was gracyous / and cer∣tayn of them that wold not do sacrifyce to the fals goddes he slewe. He was an vnyuersall man almoost in all scyences. Peas he had all his dayes but with the Iewes / and many a lawe he made. And than he cōmaunded that chrysten men sholde not be dampned to deth but with due processe. Ierusalem he subdued a∣gayne / and forbade that no Jewe sholde dwell therin by no wyse. Chrysten men he suffred there to dwell. Agaynst his wyll he came to the empyre / but he go∣uerned hym very well. Whan the sena∣tours prayed hym to call his sone empe¦rour after hym / he sayd. It is ynough to me y
t
 agaynst my wyl I haue regned whiche I haue not deserued. For y
e
 em∣pyre of Rome sholde not go by succession of blode / but to suche men as deserue it through theyr merytes.

 Brytons / but at the last he was discōfyted / & y
e
 Brytons toke hym & boūde hym handes & feet / & cast hym in to a water / wherfore y

 wa∣ter was called for euermore Walbroke. Than regned Asclepades in peas / tyll one of his erles y

¶ How Constance a Romayn that had spoused Eleyne kynge Coyls doughter was chosen kynge after kynge Coyll.


AFter this kynge Coyll Cōstance was made kynge & crowned for as moch as he had spoused kyng Coyls doughter that was heyre of the londe / the whiche Constance regned / & well & worthely gouerned the lōde. And he be∣gate on his wyfe Eleyne a sone y

 was called Cōstantyne. And this kyng bare true fayth / & truly dyd to them of Rome all his lyfe. And whā he had regned .xv. yere he dyed / and lyeth at yorke.






¶ How Constantyne that was kynge Constances sone & sone to saynt Eleyne gouerned and ruled the londe / and af∣ter was emperour of Rome.


AFter kynge Constance deth reg∣ned Constantyne his sone & sone to saynt Eleyne that foūde y

 holy crosse in the holy londe / & how Cōstantyne be∣came emperour of Rome. It befell that in that tyme there was an emperour at Rome y

 was therin of mys byleue. And than was he made empe∣rour / & was a good man / and gouerned hym so well / y
•
 all londes were to hȳ at∣tendaūt for to be vnder his gouernaūce. ¶ And this deuyll & tyraūt Ma
 y

 tyme was in the londe of Grece & herde these tydȳges / & sodeynly became wood & dyed sodeynly. ¶ Whan Constantyne went from this londe to Rome he toke with hȳ his moder Eleyne for her grete prudence / & thre other grete lordes y

 moost loued / the one was called Howell & y

 other Taberne / & y
e
 thyrde Mo

e
 erle of Cornewayle that was called Octauian And anone as this Octauian wyst that his lorde dwelled at Rome incontynent he cesed all the londe into his handes & therwith dyd all his wyll amōge 
 & lowe / & they helde hym for kyng. Whan these tydynges came to Cōstantyne the emperour / he was wonders wroth to∣warde the erle Octauyan and sent Ta∣berne with .xij. M. men agaynst hym & they arryued at Portesmouth. Whan Octauian wyst that he let assembled a grete power of Brytons & dyscomfyted hym. And Taberne fledde in to Scot∣londe / & ordeyned there a grete power / & came agayne in to this londe another tyme for to gyue batayle to Octauyan. And whan Octauyan vnderstode that / he assembled a grete power / and came towarde Taberne as fast as he myght / 


so that those two hoostes mette togyder on Stanesmore / & strongly smote togy∣der. And than was Octauyan dyscōfy∣ted / & fledde thens vnto Norway. And Taberne seased all y
e
 londe in to his han¦des bothe townes & castelles. But Octa¦uyan came agayne fro Norway with a grete power / & droue out al y
e
 Romayns & than he was made kyng of this lond.






¶ How Maximian that was the em∣perours cosyn of Rome spoused Octa∣uyans doughter / and after was made kynge of this londe.






THis Octauian gouerned y
e
 londe well and nobly / but he had none heyre / saue a doughter that was a yōge chylde / that he loued as moche as his lyf. And for as moche as he waxed seke and was in poynt of deth and might no longer regne / he wolde haue made one of his neuewes to be kyng / which was a noble knyght & a stronge man y
t
 was called Conan Meriedok: & he shold haue kepte the kynges doughter / & haue ma∣ryed her whan tyme had ben. But the lordes of y
e
 londe wolde not suffre it / but gaue her coūseyle to be maryed to some hygh man of grete honour / & thā might she haue al her lust / & the coūseyle of her lord Cōstātyne y
e
 emperour. And at this coūseyle they accorded / & chose Cador of Cornewayle for to go to y
e
 emperour on this message / & he toke y
e
 waye & went to Rome / & tolde the emperour these ty∣dynges well & wysely. And y
e
 emperour sent in to this londe with hym his owne cosyn that was his vncles sone a noble knyght & a stronge y
t
 was called Maxi∣myan / & he spoused Octauyans dough∣ter / & was crowned kyng of this londe.






¶ How Maximian that was the empe¦rours cosyn cōquered y
e
 londe of Amori∣can / & gaue it to Conan Meriedok.


THis kyng Maximian became so ryall y
t
 he thought to conquere y
e
 londe of Amorican for y
e
 grete rychesse y
t
 he herde tell that was in y
•
 londe / so y
t
 he ne left no man of worthynes / knyght ne squyer / ne none other mā y
t
 he ne toke w
t
 him / to y
e
 grete domage of all y
e
 lōde. For he lefte at home no man to kepe y
e
 londe / for he had w
t
 hym .xxx. M. knyghtes of good mennes bodyes / & went ouer in to the londe of Amorican / & there slewe the kyng that was called Imball / and con¦quered all the londe. And whan he had so done / he called Conan & sayd. For as moche as kyng Octauyan wolde haue made you kyng of Brytayn / & through me ye were let & dystroubled y
•
 ye were not kyng / I gyue you this lōde of Amo∣rican / & make you kyng therof. And for as moche as ye be a bryton / I wyl that this lōde haue the same name / and that it be no more called Amorican / but shall be called lytell Brytayne / and the londe fro whens we be comen / shall be called fro hens forth grete Brytayne. And so shall men knowe that one Brytayne fro that other. Thā this Conan Meriedok


thanked hȳ curteysly / & so was he made kynge of lytell Brytayn. And whan all this was done Maximyan went from thens vnto Rome / and was than made emperour after Constantyne. And Co∣nan Meriedok dwelled in lytell Britayn with moche honour / & there let ordeyne two. M. plowmen of the londe for to ere the londe / to harowe & sowe it / & feffed them rychely after y
t
 they were. And for as moche as kynge Conan & none of his knyghtes / ne none of his other people wolde not take wyues of the nacyon of fraūce / he sent in to grete Brytayne to y
e
 erle of Cornewayle that men called Dio nothe / that he sholde chose through out all this lōde .xj. M. maydens / that is to saye .viij. M. for the meane people / & .iij. M. for y
e
 gretest lordes that sholde them spouse. And whā Dionothe vnderstode this / he made a cōmaūdement through out all the londe of Brytayn / & as many as the nombre came to he assembled to∣gyder of maydēs / for there was no man that durst withstande his cōmaūdemēt bycause he was protectour. And whan these maydens were assembled / he let them come before hym at London / & let ordeyne shyppes for them hastely / w
t
 all that therto belonged. And toke his own doughter that was called Vrsula / that was y
e
 fayrest creature y
•
 ony man wyst And he wolde haue sent her to kyng Co¦nan y
t
 shold haue spoused her & made her quene of y
e
 londe. But she had made pry∣uely to god a vowe of chastite y
t
 her fader wyst not / ne none other man lyuynge.






¶ How Vrsula and .xj. M. maydens that were in her company wente to∣warde lytell Brytayne / and all they were martyred at Coleyne.


THis Vrsula those vnto her com∣pany .xj. M. maydens that of all other she was lady & maystresse / and all they toke shyppynge at one tyme in the water that is called Tamyse / & cōmaū∣ded her kyn & frendes to almyghty god and sayled toward lytell Brytayn. But whan they were comen in to y
e
 hygh see a stronge tēpest arose as it was goddes wyll / & Vrsula with her shyppes & her cōpany were dryuē to Hunlōde through tempest / & arryued in y
•
 hauen of the cite of Coleyne. And the kynge of the londe that was called Gowan was than in y
•
 cite / & whan he wyst the tydynges that so many fayre maydens were there ar∣ryued / he toke Elga his broder & other of his housholde with hym and went to the shyppes to se that fayre company. And whan he sawe them so fayre / he & his cōpany 
wold
 haue ouer
ayen them and haue taken fro them theyr virgy
∣te. But Vrsula that good virgyn coun∣seyled / prayed / warned / & taught then: that were her felawes / that they shol
 defend them with all theyr myght / and rather suffre deth than suffre theyr bo∣dyes to be defouled. So that all the vir∣gyns became so stedfast in god that they defended them through his grace that none of them had power to do them sha∣me. Wherfore kynge Gowan was sort anoyed / that he for wrathe slewe them euerychone anone ryght. And so were all those virgyns martyred for the 
our of god / and they lye at Coleyn.






¶ How kynge Gowan came for to destroye this londe / and how a man of grete power that was called Gra¦cian defended the londe.


WHan all this was done / kynge Gowan whiche was a sarasyn called to hym his broder Elga and sayd to hym that he sholde go and conquere the londe that all those fayre


maydens were borne in. And thā he or∣deyned a grete power of Pehites of den¦marke / of Orkeney / & of Norway. And they came in to this londe & brent tow∣nes / & slewe folke / & cast down chirches & houses of religyon / & robbed the londe in length & brede / & put to deth all those that wolde not forsake y
e
 ryght byleue & chrystēdom. For as moche as there was no souerayne y
t
 myght helpe them. For the kyng Maximian had taken w
t
 hym all y
e
 worthy men whan he went to con∣quere lytell Brytayn. And in y
e
 same ty∣me was saynt Albon martyred through the wode tyraūt Dioclesyan / in y
e
 same place where is now an abbey made of saynt Albons / whyles y
t
 he was a pay∣nym. But he was conuerted vnto god through the predycacyon of a clerke & a wyse man that was called Ancibel that was herborowed a nyght in his hous. And this was after y
e
 incarnacion of Ie¦su Chryst .CC .xxvj. yere. And it is to be vnderstāde that saint Albon suffred his martyrdom before saynt Edmond. And therfore is saȳt Albon called y
e
 fyrst mar¦tyr of Englonde. ¶ This Gowans bro∣der & his folke that were sarasyns went through out the londe and destroyed all thynge y
t
 they founde & no thynge they spared. Whan these tydynges came to Rome how y
e
 kynge Gowan had begon for to destroye this londe / the emperour & the Romayns sent a stronge man & of grete power y
t
 was called Gracien with xxiiij. M. fyghtynge men / for to cast out of this londe all those sarasyns. And all they arryued at Portesmouth. Maxi∣mian myght not come himselfe bycause he was chosen emperour after the deth of Cōstantyne y
t
 was saynt Eleyns sone Whan this Gracian was arriued with his hoost / he let espye pryuely where y
e
 kynge Gowan myght be foūde / & he set vpō them sodeynly as they lay in theyr beddes / & discōfyted them & slewe them in theyr beddes euerichone / that none of them escaped: saue Gowan y
t
 fledde in to his owne coūtre w
t
 grete sorowe. Soone after it befell y
e
 Maximyan was slayne at Rome through treason. And whan Gracian wyst of those tydynges / he let crowne hymselfe kynge of this londe.






¶ How Gracian made him kyng whan Maximyan was slayne / & afterward y
e
 Britons slewe hym for his wyckednes.


THis Gracian whan he began to regne / he became so wycked and so sterne / and so moche sorow dyd to the Brytons that they slewe hym amonge them. Whan kyng Gowan vnderstode that Gracian was slayne / he assembled a grete power & came agayne in to this londe / and yf he had fyrst done harme than dyd he moche more. For he than destroyed all this londe and the chrysten people that were therin / so that no man was so hardy to name god / and yf they dyd they were put to straūge deth. But the bysshop of London y
t
 was tho whi∣che was called Gosselyn scaped & went thens to them of Rome to seke socour to helpe to destroye the sarasyns that had destroyed this londe. And the Romayns sayd y
t
 they had ben so often anoyed for theyr sendyng of folke in to Britayne all for to helpe the Britons / & they wold no more so do. And so the bysshop Gosselyn went thens without ony socour or hel∣pe. And than went he to y
e
 kyng of lytell Brytayne y
t
 was called Aldroie / & this was y
e
 thyrde kyng after Gowan Me∣riedok / as before is sayd. The bysshop prayed this kynge Aldroie of helpe & so∣cour. And y
e
 kynge had pite in his herte whan he herde how y
e
 bysshop fledde / & how the chrysten men were so slayne in grete Brytayne through y
e
 paynyms &


sarasyns / he graūted hym Cōstantyne his bro
er for to helpe hym with power of folke. And cha
 dyd araye hors / har∣neys & shyppes & all thynge y
t
 neded to that vyage. And whan all thynge was redy / he called y
e
 bysshop & sayd to hym. I take you here Cōstantyne my broder vpon this couenaūt / y
t
 yf god gyue hym grace to discōfyte y
e
 infydelēs / that than ye shall make hym kyng. And y
e
 bisshop graūted it w
t
 a good wyll. Cōstantyne & the bysshop toke leue of y
e
 kyng Aldroie / & betoke hym to god / & toke .xij. M
inen & went to theyr shippes / & sayled towar¦de grete Britayn / & arryued at Totnes. Whan y
e
 Britons herdethese tydynges that socour came / they were glad / & or∣deyned them an huge nō
re of people / & went & receyued them w
t
 moche honour ¶ Gowan anone as he wyst of these ty dynges / he assembled all his farasyns & came agaynst them & gaue thē batayle. And Cōstantyn slewe hym w
t
 his owne handes / & all the other sarasyns were dyscomfyted & slayne y
t
 none escaped / ex∣cepte those that were couerted to god.






¶ How Constantyne that was the kynges broder of lytel Britayn was crowned kynge of grete Brytayne for his worthynes.


ANone after y
e
 batayle they went to London & crowned there Con¦stantyne kyng of this londe / & y
e
 bysshop Gosselin set the crowne on his heed / and a
oynted hȳ as it belongeth for a kyng. And thā began christēdom in this londe agayn. And anone after whā this kyng Constantyn was crowned he spoused a wyfe through roūseyle of y
e
 Brytons / & begate on herthre sones. The fyrst was called Cōstance / y
e
 seconde Aurilambros & the thyrde Vter. This Constance y
t
 el∣der broder whā he came to o
 he 
 hym a monke at Wynchestre. And Con¦stātyne theyr fader was slayne through treason. For it befell vpon a tyme that a Pehyte came to hym vpon a daye as it were on a message / & sayd that he wol∣de speke with the kynge pryuely in coū∣seyle. The kyng let 
oyde his chambre of the men that were there within / and there abode no moo but the kynge and the Pehite / and he made a countenaūce as though he wolde haue spoken with the kyng in his eere. And there he shewe hym with a longe knyfe. And after that he went meruaylously out of that cham¦bre in to an other chambre / so that at the last no man wyst where he was b
ro∣men. Whan the kynges men wyst that theyr lord was so deed / they made than so moche sorowe / y
t
 they wyst not what for to do. For as moche as his two sones Aurilambros and Vter were so yonge / that none of them myght be kynge and the thyrde broder was a monke at 
 chestre as is sayd before. But 
o
nger that was erle of Westler thought pry∣uely in his herte through some subry
e for to be kynge hymselfe. And wente to Wynchestre where as Constance was monke / & sayd to hym. Cōstance qued be your fader is deed / & your two brethern that ben w
t
 Gosselyn the bysshop of Lon¦don to nourysshe / be so yonge that neue of them may be kyng wherfore I coū∣seyle you that ye forsake your habyte & come with me / and I shall make suche a meane vnto the Brytons that ye shall be made kynge of this londe.






¶ Of Constance that was kynge Con∣stantynes sone / whiche was a monke at Wynchestre / and how he was made kynge after his faders dethe / through counseyle of 
o
ger that was 
e of Westser for as moche as Aurilambros and 
 his two bretherne were but


yonge of age. And Vortiger let shee 
ya
 for to be kynge hymselfe.


THis Vortiger coūseyled this Cō∣s
āce so moche tyll he forsoke his ab
ot and went with hym. And anone after he was crowned kyng by y
e
 assent of the Brytons. This kynge Constance whan he was crowned & made kynge he wyll ne knewe but lytell of y
e
 worlde nor coude no thynge what knyghthode axed. And he made Vortyger his chefe mayster & coūseyler / & gaue hym all his power for to ordeyn & to do as moche as to y
e
 realme aperteyned. So y
t
 hymselfe no thynge entermedled / but onely bare the name of kyng. Whā Vortiger sawe that he had all y
e
 lōde in his warde & go∣uernaūce at his owne wyll / he thought by preuy treason to slee Cōstance y
e
 kyng that he myght hȳselfe be crowned & ma¦de kyng & regne / & let sende after an hon¦dred knyghtes of Pehytes / y
e
 worthyest of all y
e
 londe / & them helde w
t
 hym for to dwell / as to be kepers of his body / as he wolde go through the londe to ordeyne thynges y
t
 appertayned to a kyng. And this Vortiger honoured so moche y
e
 hon¦dred knyghtes & so moche gaue them of golde & syluer & of ryche iewelles / robes horses & other thȳges plente / wherfore they helde hym more lord than they dyd the kyng. And Vortiger told them: yf he myght be kyng / ye as it were through treason / he wold make them rychest of y
e
 londe. So at y
e
 last through grete gyftes that he had gyuen largely / they cryed through y
e
 court y
t
 Vortiger were better worthy to be kyng thā Cōstance. Wher∣fore Vortiger made semblaūt as he had ben wroth / & he departed thens from y
e
 courte / and sayd he must go elles where for thinges that he had to do. And so the traytour sayd bycause y
t
 they sholde slee kynge Constance. Whan this Vortiger was gone / it befel soon easter 
 those hondred knyghtes of Pe

Engist.




THis tyme came the saxons that were pagans fyrst in to Britayn now called Englonde / vnder Vortiger y
•
 whiche was crowned kyng of this lon∣de. This tyme those that had these two chyldren in kepyng the which were Cō¦stantynes sones / that is to saye / Auri∣lambros and Vter through ordynaunce of Gosselyn that was bysshop of Lon∣don / after theyr faders dethe / that is to saye Cōstantyne / durst not dwell in this londe with those children / but conuayed them vnto the kynge of lytell Brytayn / for as moche as he knewe the treason of Vortiger that than was made kynge / through whome Constance theyr elder broder was slayne / wherfore y
•
 hondred knyghtes of Pehytes were put to deth and bare al the blame / as that Vortiger had not wyst therof / ne therto cōsented. And so the kepers of those two chyldren dred lest Vortiger wolde put thē to deth through his treason & falsnes as he had done theyr broder before / & therfore they were ladde ouer in to lytell Brytayne / & the kynge them receyued w
t
 moche ho∣nour / & put them to nourysshe / & there they dwelled tyll they became fayre and strōge knyghtes / & thought to be auen∣ged of the deth of Cōstance theyr broder whan they sawe theyr tyme / & so they dyd as ye shal here tell afterward. ¶ It was not longe after that the tydynges came ouer see to the kynrede of the hon∣dred knyghtes of Pehytes y
•
 they were dampned & put to deth through Vorti∣ger in this londe / wherfore they were wondersly wroth / and swore that they wolde be auenged of the dethe of theyr kynnesmen / & came in to this lond with a grete power / & robbed & slewe in ma∣ny places / & dyd all the sorowe that they myght. Whan Vortiger it wyst / he ma de moche sorowe / and was sore anoyed. And in another place also tydnges came to hym that Aurilambros and Vter his broder ordeyned and assembled a grete hoost for to come in to grete Britayn / for to be auenged vpon Vortiger for y
•
 deth of theyr broder Constance. So that on y
•
 one syde & on the other he was brought in to so moche sorowe that he ne wyst wheder to go.




¶ How Engyst and .xj. thousande men came in to this lōde / to whom Vortiger gaue a place y
•
 is called Thonge castell.


ANd soone after this sorowe ty∣dynges came to Vortiger that a grete nauye of straūgers were arryued in y
•
 coūtree of Kent / & wyst not whens they were / ne wherfore they were comē in to this londe. The kynge sent anone a messenger thyder / that some of them sholde come & speke w
t
 hym for to knowe what folke they were / & what they as∣ked / & in to what coūtre they wolde go. There were two bretherne maysters & prynces of that stronge company / y
•
 one was called Engist / & that other Horne. Engist went to the kyng and tolde hym the cause wherfore they were comen in to this londe / & sayd. Syr we be of a coū tree y
•
 is called Saxonie / that is y
•
 londe of Germayne / wherin is so moche so∣rowe that of the people be so many that


the londe may not them susteyne. And y
•
 prynces & maisters of the londe make to come before them men & womē of y
•
 bol∣d
st y
•
 may best trauayle in to diuers lon des / & gyue them hors & harneys / & al y
•
 them nedeth / & thā they byd them go in to an other to 
e where they may lyue as theyr aūceters dyd before them. And therfore syr kynge / yf ye wyll haue our seruice we wyll helpe you against your enemyes. Whan Vortiger herd this / he sayd gladly he wold w
t
holde them vpon suche couenaūt y
•
 yf they might delyuer his londe of his enemyes / he wold gyue them reasonable lōdes for to dwell in for euer. Engist thanked hym goodly / & in this maner he & his cōpany .xj. M. were reteyned w
t
 kyng Vortiger / & at the last delyuered clene y
•
 londe of his enemyes. Than prayed Engist the kyng of so mo∣che lōde y
•
 he myght make for hym & his folke a cite. The kyng answered / it was not to do w
t
out coūseyle of his brytons. Engist prayed hym agayn of as moche place as he might compasse w
t
 a thonge of a skyn / wheron he might make a ma¦ner for hȳ to dwell in. And y
•
 kyng graū∣ted him frely. Than Engist cut a bulles skyn as small as he myght in to a thōge & therw
t
 compassed as moche lond as he myght buylde on a fayre castell / & was called Thong castell.






¶ How Vortiger loued Ronewen Engi¦stes doughter / & how he spoused her.






WHan this castell was made and well arayd / Engist pryuely sent by lettre in to the coūtree where he came fro for an hondred shyppes fyl∣led with men that were stronge & bolde and also well fyghtyng in all batayles / and that they sholde also brynge with them Ronewen his doughter / whiche was the fayrest creature that ony man myght se. And whan those people were comen that he had sente for / he toke and ladde them in to the castell with moche Ioye. And hymselfe vpon a daye went vnto the kynge / and prayed hym there full worthely that he wolde come and se his newe manoyr that he had made in the place that he had compassed with the thonge of the skynne. The kynge a∣none frely graunted hym / & went with hym thyder / and was full well pleased with the castell & with the fayre weeke And togyder there they ete and dranke with moche ioye. And whan nyght ca∣me that kynge Vortiger sholde go in to his chambre to take there his nyghtes rest / Ronewen y
•
 was Engistes dough∣ter came with a cup of golde in her hāde and kneled before the kynge and sayd to hym wassayll. And the kynge wyst no
 what it was to mene 
e what he shold answere therto / for as moche as hym selfe nor none of his brytons coude speke none Englysshe nor vnderstande it / but spake in y
•
 same language that Britons do yet. Neuerthelesse a latiner tolde the kynge the full vnderstandynge of wa
∣sayll / & that other shold answere drynke hayll. And that was the fyrst tyme that wassayll and drynke hayll came vp in this londe / and frō that tyme vnto this tyme it is well vsed in all this realme of Englonde. And whan kynge Vorti∣ger behelde y
•
 grete beaute of this fayre lady Ronewen that kneled before hym / he toke her vp & layde bothe his armes


aboute her necke / & thryes swetely kys∣sed her / & anone ryght he was enamou∣red vpon her / so that he desyred to haue her to wyfe / and asked her of Engist her fader. And Engist graunted hym vpon this couenaūt / that the kyng shold gyue hym all y
e
 coūtree of Kent / that he & his people myght dwell therin. The kynge graūted hym pryuely with a good wyll And anone after he spoused y
e
 damoysell and that was moche confusyon to hym selfe. And therfore all y
e
 brytons became wrothe bycause he spoused a woman of mysbyleue / wherfore they went all frō hȳ / & wold do no thynge y
t
 he had to do.






¶ How Vortimer that was Vortigers sone was made kyng / & Engyst dryuen out / & how Vortimer was poysoned.


THis Engist went in to Kent and seased all y
e
 londe in to his hādes for hym & for his men / & became within a lytel whyle of so grete power / & had so moche people / that men wyst not in litel tyme whiche were y
e
 kȳges men & whi∣che were Engystes / wherfore the Bry∣tons had of hym drede / & sayd amonge them / but yf they ne toke other coūseyle bytwene them / all the londe 
shold
 be de∣stroyed through Engist and his people. Vortiger y
e
 kyng had begotē on his fyrst wyfe thre sones / y
e
 fyrst was called Vor¦timer / the seconde Catagren / & y
e
 thyrde Passent. The brytōs by one assent chose Vortimer to be theyr lorde & souerayne / & crowned hym kyng / & wold not suffre Vortiger no longer to regne / bycause of the alyaūce bytwene Engist and hym. The brytons ordeyned a grete hoost for to dryue out Engist & his company of y
e
 londe / and gaue hym thre batayles / the fyrst was in Kent where he was lorde / the seconde was at 
Tetford
 / & y
e
 thyrde was in a shyre on this side Colchestre in a moor. And in this batayle mette them Catagren & Horne Engystes broder / so that eche of them slewe other. But for as moche as y
e
 coūtre was gyuen longe before to Horne through Vortiger whā he spoused his cosyn / there he made a fayre castell that is called Horne castell after his owne name. Vortimer was so sore anoyed for his broders deth / that a∣none he let cast downe y
e
 castell to y
e
 erth. And after he stynted not nyght nor daye tyll he had dryuen out Engyst & all his people of the londe. And than Ronewen his doughter made grete sorowe / and craftely spake to them that were nexte to the kyng Vortimer / & pryuely entrea¦ted them / and so many gyftes she gaue them / that the kynge was empoysoned and dyed at London the fourth yere of his regne / and there he lyeth.






¶ How the britons chose an other tyme Vortiger to be theyr kynge / and Engist came in to this londe agayne / and how they fought togyder.


AFter Vortimers dethe the Bry∣tons by theyr comyn assent ma∣de Vortiger agayne theyr kynge vpon this couenaunt / that he sholde neuer af∣ter suffre Engist nor none of his to come agayne in to this londe. And whan all this was done / Ronewen the quene pry¦uely sent by lettre to Engist that she had empoysoned Vortimer / and that Vorti∣ger her lorde bare agayne the crowne & regned / and that he sholde come agayne in to this londe wel arayed with moche people for to auenge hym vpon the bry∣tons / and to wynne this londe agayne by myght and strength. And whan En¦gist herde these tydynges / he made gre∣te ioye / & apparayled hym hastely with xv. thousande men that were boughty in euery batayle / & came in to this lon∣de.


And whan Vortiger herde tell that Engist was comen agayn with a grete power in to this londe / he assembled his brytons & went to mete Engist for to gy¦ue hym batayle. But Engist dredyng y
e
 brytons sore / for they had dyscōfyted hȳ before / prayed Vortiger of a loue day / & sayd he was not comen in to this londe for to fyght / but for to haue his londe a∣gayn / yf he myght accord w
t
 the brytōs. Kyng Vortiger through coūseyle of his brytons graūted hym a loue day. And it was ordeyned by the brytons y
t
 the loue daye shold be holden besyde Salysbury on an hyll / & Engyst sholde come thyder with. iiij .C. knyghtes & no moo. And y
e
 kyng w
t
 as many of y
e
 wysest men of his londe. And at y
t
 daye y
e
 kyng came w
t
 his coūseyle as it was ordeined. But Engist had warned his knightes pryuely that eche of them sholde put a longe knyfe in his hose / & whan he sayd fayre syrs it is tyme to speke of loue & peas / euery man anone shold drawe out his knyfe & slee a bryton. And so they slewe a. M. and .lxj. knyghtes / & with moche sorowe many o
 them escaped. And y
e
 kynge Vortiger there was taken & ledde to Thongcastel and put in prison. And some of Engistes men wolde that the kyng had ben brent all quycke. And Vortiger than for to ha∣ue his lyfe graunted them as moche as they wolde aske / & gaue vp all the londe townes / castelles / cytees & bourghes to Engyst & his folke. And all the brytons fledde thens in to Wales / & there helde them styll. And Engist went through y
e
 londe & seased all the londe w
t
 fraūchises & in euery place let cast down chirches & houses of religyon / & destroyed y
e
 chrystē fayth through out all this londe / and let chaūge the name of y
e
 londe / y
t
 no man of his were so hardy after that tyme to cal this lōde Britayn / but call it Engist lōde And thā he departed y
e
 londe to his men and made .vij. kynges for to strengthe y
e
 londe / that y
e
 brytons sholde neuer after come therin. The fyrst kyngdome was Kent / where Engist hymselfe regned / & was lorde & mayster ouer all the other. The .ij. was Southsex / y
t
 now is called Chichestre. The .iij. Westsex. The .iiij. Eestsex. The .v. Estangyl / y
t
 now is cal∣led Norfolk / Suffolk / Mercheme
k / y
t
 is to saye y
e
 erledom of Nicholl. The. v
. had Leycestre shyre / Northamton shyre Herforde / & Huntyngdon. The .vij. had Oxforde / Glocestre / Wynchestre / War∣wyk / and Derby shyre.






¶ How Vortiger wente in to Wales / & began there a castell y
t
 wolde not stande without morter tempred with blode.


WHan Engist had departed all the londe in this maner to his men / & delyuered Vortiger out of pryson to go where he wold / & he toke his way in to wales where his brytons dwelled / for y
t
 londe was stronge & yll to wynne / & En¦gist neuer came there 
e neuer knewe 
. Vortiger helde hym there w
t
 his brytōs & asked coūseyle what was best to do
 & they gaue hȳ coūseyle to make a strong castell / y
t
 he might kepe & defende hȳself therin yf nede were. ¶ Masons in haste were fette / & began y
e
 werke vpon y
e
 hyll of Breigh. But certes thus it befel
 all y
e
 werke y
t
 the masons made a daye 
t fe
l downe y
e
 night / & they wyst not what it myght be / & therof y
e
 kynge was sore a∣noyed of y
t
 chaūce / & wyst not what to do Wherfore he let send after y
e
 wysest cler∣kes & lerned men that were through out wales y
t
 myght be foūde / for they 
shold
 hym tell wherfore y
e
 foūdamēt so fayled vnder the werke / & that they shold hym tell what was best to do. And whā these wyse men longe tyme had studyed / they sayd to y
e
 kyng y
t
 he sholde do seke a chil∣de borne of a woman y
t
 neuer had to do


with man / and that chylde he sholde do slee / & tempre with his blode the morter of the werke / and so sholde the werke euer endure without ende.






¶ How y
e
 kyng let seke Merlin through out all Wales for to speke with hym.






WHan the kyng herde this / he cō∣maūded his messengers anone to go through out all Wales to seke that chylde / yf they myght fynde hym / and that they sholde brynge hym forth with them vnto hym. And in re∣corde and in wytnes of this thynge he had taken them his lettres / that they ne were destroubled of no man ne lette. And than y
e
 messengers went thens & spedde so fast / that they came in to a town that was called Karmardyne / and as they passed forth theyr waye / they foūde two chyldren of .xxiiij. yere of age chydynge togyder with hasty wordes / and one of them sayd to that other. Donebat quod he / ye do all wronge to stryue with me / for ye haue no wytte ne no reason as I haue. Certes Merlyn quod he / of your wytte ne your reason I make no forte / for men tell comynly y
t
 ye haue no thȳge of god almyghty / syth ye had neuer fa∣der / but euery man knoweth well who was your moder. ¶ The messengers of kynge Vortiger whan they herde this stryfe bytwene y
e
 two gromes / they as∣ked of them y
t
 stode besyde them whens that Merlyn was borne / and also who nourysshed hym. And they tolde them y
t
 a grete gentylwoman of Karmardyne called Adhan was his moder / but none knewe who was his fader. Whan the kynges messengers herd these tydȳges they went anone to hym that was war¦deyne of y
e
 towne & tolde hym y
e
 kynges wyll / & shewed hym his lettre / & wher∣fore they were comen thyder. Merlyn & his moder anone were fetched before the wardeyn of y
e
 towne / & he cōmaūded thē that they sholde go to y
e
 kynge with his messengers. Merlyn & his moder went thens & came vnto y
e
 kyng / & there they were receyued w
t
 moche honour. And y
e
 kyng asked of the lady yf y
t
 chylde were her sone / & who hym begate. The lady answered full tenderly wepynge & sayd she neuer had company of man worldly But syr sayd she / whan I was a yonge mayden in my faders chambre / w
t
 other of grete lignage in my cōpany / that oftē tymes went to sporte them / I left alone in my chambre & wolde not go forth for brēnynge of y
e
 sonne / there came on a ty∣me a fayre bacheler & entred ī my cham∣bre where I was alone / but how he ca∣me in / & where / I wyst it neuer / ne yet knowe I not / for y
e
 dores were fast bar∣red / & w
t
 me he dyd game of loue. For I had no myght nor power to defende me from hȳ. And oftē he came to me in y
e
 fore sayd maner / so y
t
 he begate this chylde / but neuer myght I wyte what he was.






¶ Of the answere of Merlyn vpon the kynges castell that wolde not stande.


WHan Merlyn had herde all that his moder had sayd / he spake to the kynge in this maner. ¶ Syr


how I was begoten aske ye no more / for it falleth not to you nor to none other to knowe / but tell me y
e
 cause wherfore I am brought to you / & wherfore ye haue sent for me. Certes quod the kynge / my wyse coūseylers haue done me to vnder∣stande / that y
e
 morter of a werke that I haue begon behoueth to be tēpred with your blode / or the foūdament shall fayle for euermore. Syr said Merlin / wyll ye slee me for my blode to tempre with your morter. Ye quod the kynge / or elles shall neuer my castell stāde / as my coūseylers tell me. Than answered Merlyn to the kyng. Syr said he / let them come before me those wyse coūseylers / & I wyll pre∣ue that they saye not well ne truly. And whan the wyse men were comen / Mer∣lyn asked yf his blode were the cause to make y
e
 werke stande & endure. All those wyse men were abasshed and coude not answere. Than sayd Merlyn to y
e
 kyng Syr I shall tell you the cause wherfore your werke thus falleth & may not stan¦de. There is vnder the moūtayn where ye buylde your toure a grete pond of wa¦ter / & in the bottom of y
e
 ponde vnder the water there is two dragons / that one is whyte & that other reed / that fyght to∣gyder agaynst your werke. Do ye depe myne tyll your men come to the pond / & do your men take away y
e
 water all out & than ye shal se the dragons as I haue tolde you / y
t
 fight togyder agaynst your werke. And this is the cause wherfore the foūdament falleth. The kyng anone let dygge vnder tyll y
e
 men came to that ponde / & let do away all y
e
 water / & there they foūde two dragons as Merlin had tolde them that egerly f
ught togyder. The whyte dragon egerly assayled the reed / & layde on hym so strongly that he myght not endure / but withdrewe him 
 rested in the same caue. And whan he had a whyle rested hym / he went before the reed dragon & assayled hym angerly & helde hym so sore / that he myght not endure agaynst hym / but w
t
 drewe hym & rested. And after came agayn y
e
 whyte dragon & strongly fought w
t
 the reed dra¦gon / & bote hym euyl & ouercame hym y
e
 he fled frō thens & no more came agayn.






¶ Of the significacyon of these two dragons that were in the bottom of the ponde that fought togyder.


His kyng Vortiger & his men y
e
 sawe this bataile had grete mer¦uayle / & prayed Merlyn to tell hȳ what it myght betoken. Syr sayd Merlyn / I shall tell you. The reed dragon betoke∣neth your selfe / & the whyte betokeneth the folke of Saxonie that fyrst ye toke & helde in your lond / that fought agaynst you / & haue dryuen & chaced you awaye But Britons of your lignage ouercame them & droue them awaye. And sythen at the comynge agayne of the Sarons they recouered this londe / & helde it for euermore / & droue out the brytōs / & dyd with this lōde al theyr wyll & destroyed chrystendom through out this londe. Ye had fyrst ioye w
t
 theyr comyng / but now it is turned to your grete domage & so∣rowe. For the two bretherne of Cōstance that was kyng / whiche ye let see shall come before a quinzeme passed w
t
 a grete power frō lytel Brytayn / & shall auenge the deth of theyr broder / and they shall brenne you fyrst with sorowe / and af∣terwarde they shall slee a grete parte of saxons / & shall dryue out all y
e
 
emenaūt of the londe / & therfore abyde ye here no lenger to make castel ne none other w
r¦ke / but anone go els where to saue your lyfe. To god I you betake / trouth I ha¦ue sayd to you of thynges y
t
 shall be fall. And vnderstande ye well that Aurilam bros shall be kynge / but he shall be poy∣soned / & lytell tyme shall he regne.








¶ Of kynge Aurilambros / and how he pursued Vortiger and Eugist / and how they dyed.


MErlyn & his moder departed frō the kynge / and returned agayne to Karmardyne. And soone after tydyn∣ges came to the Brytons that Aurilam bros and Vter his broder were arryued at Totnes with a grete host. And anone the Brytons assembled them and went to receyue Aurilambros and Vter with grete noblenes / & brought them to Lon∣don / and crowned Aurilambros & made hym kyng / and dyd vnto hym homage. And anone he asked where as Vortiger myght be foūde that was kynge / for he wolde be auenged of his broders deth / and after he wolde warre vpon y
e
 pay∣nyms. And they tolde hym that Vorti∣ger was in wales / & so they ladde hym thyder warde. Vortiger wyst well that those bretherne came to conquere hym / and fledde thens into a castell that was called Gerneth / that stode vpon an hye moūtayne / and there helde hym. Auri∣lambros and Vter his broder and theyr folke had besyeged the castell full longe tyme / for the castell was stronge & well arayed. So at the last they kest wylde fyre and brente houses and men and all theyr araye & as moche as was within the castell. So that Vortiger was brent amonge all other / and so he dyed with moche sorowe. ¶ Than was Engist in Kent and regned there / and herde these tydynges / anone he fledde & wolde haue gone in to Scotlonde for to haue had so∣coure. But Aurilambros and his folke mette with hym in the north countree / and gaue hym batayle. And Engist and his men defended them whyles y
t
 they myght / but he and his folke were dys∣comfited and slayne. And Otta his sone fledde vnto yorke. And Aurilambros fo∣lowed hym egerly. And Otta with stode hym a lytell whyle / but afterwarde he put hym to his mercy. And Aurilabros receyued hym / and to hym & to his men gaue the countree of Galeway in Scot∣londe / & there they dwelled. After that the kynge Aurilambros went through out the londe / and put awaye the name of Engyst londe / that Engyst after his name had called it before. Than he let call it agayne grete Brytayne / and let make agayn chirches and houses of re∣lygyon / castelles / cytees / and borowes and townes that the Saxous had de∣stroyed / and came to London / and dyd do make the walles of the cyte / whiche Engist & his folke had cast downe. The Brytons ladde hym to the moūt of Am∣brian where somtyme was an hous of relygyon whiche than was destroyed through y
e
 paynyms / wherof a knyght that was called Ambry that somtyme was foūder of that hous / and therfore the hyll was called the mount of Am∣bryan. And after it was called Ambes∣bury / and shall be so for euermore.






¶ How Aurilambros dyd redresse the londe of grete Brytayne / whiche was destroyed through the Saxons.


HOw the kynge Aurilambros let amende and redresse the hous of Ambesbury / and put there in monkes / but now there be Nonnes / alytell from the place that was called Salysbury / or where as the Saxons slewe the Bri∣tons / where as Engist and the Britons sholde haue made a loue daye / in y
t
 whi∣che tyme there were slayne a thousande & .lxj. knyghtes through treason of En∣gist. The kynge therof had grete pyte / & thought to make in mynde of them a monument of stone that myght endure to the worldes ende. And of this thynge


they toke theyr counseyle what therof was best to do. Than spake to y
e
 kynge the bysshop of London that was called Ternekyn y
t
 he shold enquyre after Mer lyn / for he coude best tell how this thȳge myght best be made. And Merlyn after was sought & foūde / & came to y
e
 kynge. And the kyng tolde hym his wyll of the monument y
t
 he wold haue made. Mer∣lyn answered to y
e
 kynge & sayd. There ben grete stones in Irlond & longe vpon the hyll of Kian y
t
 ben called gyaūtes ka roll / & yf they were in this place as they be there / they wold endure for euermore in remembraūce of those knyghtes that here be buryed. Perma foy sayd y
e
 kyng as harde stones ben in my lōde as in Ir lōde. Soth sayd Merlyn / but in all your londe there be none suche. For gyauntes set them for grete good of themselfe. For at euery tyme y
t
 they were woūded or in ony maner hurt / they wasshed y
e
 stones with hote water / and thā they wasshed them therwith / & anone they were hole.






¶ How the Brytons went for to seke the grete stones in Irlonde.


ANd whā these Britōs had herd of this thȳge they went & swore amonge them that they wolde goo seke those stones / & toke with them Vter the kȳges broder to be theyr chefe capitayn and .v. M. mē / & Merlin coūseyled them for to go vnto Irlonde / and so they dyd. And whan the kynge of Irlonde y
t
 was called Guillomer herde tell y
e
 straūgers were arriued in his londe / he assembled a grete power / & fought agaynst them / but he & his folke were discōfyted. The Brytons wente before tyll they came to the moūt of Kylian / & clymmed vp vnto the moūt. But whan they sawe the sto∣nes / & the maner how they stode / they had grete meruayle / and sayd bytwene themselfe that no man sholde them re∣meue for no strength ne engyne so grete they were & so lōge. But Merlin thrugh his crafte he remeued them / & brought them in to theyr shyppes & came agayn in to this londe. And Merlin set y
e
 stones where the kyng wolde haue them / & set them in the same maner that they stode in Irlonde. And whan y
e
 kynge sawe y
t
 it was made / he thāked Merlin & ryche ly hym rewarded at his own wyll / & let call y
e
 place Stonehenge for euermore.






¶ How Passent y
t
 was Vortigers sone & kyng Guillomer came in to this londe & how a traytour that was called Cap∣pa empoysoned y
e
 kyng Aurilambros.


ANd men shall vnderstāde y
e
 Pas∣sent y
t
 was Vortigers sone liued the same tyme / & came in to this lond w
t
 a grete power / & arryued in y
e
 north coū∣tre / & wold be auēged of his faders deth Vortiger / & strongly trusted vpon y
e
 com pany that he had brought w
t
 hym out of the londe of Germany / & had conquered all y
e
 North coūtre vnto Yorke. And whā kyng Aurilambros herde this he assem bled a grete power of britons & went for to fyght with Passent / & he discomfyted Passent and al his people. But Passent escaped thens with some of his men & fledde thens in to Irlōde & came to kyng Guillomer / & prayed hym of helpe & so∣cour. The kynge graūted hym w
t
 good wyll / & sayd y
t
 he wold helpe hym vpon that couenaunt that I my selfe must go with you with all my power in to Bry∣tayne / and I wold me auenge vpon the Brytons the rather / for they came in to my londe / & toke y
e
 stones with strength that is called gyaūtes karoll. The kyng Guillomer let ordeyne his shyppes and went to the see with .xv. 
. men / & ar∣ryued in wales / & began to robbe & dyd


moche sorowe. ¶ It befell so that kyng Aurilambros lay feke at Wynchestre / & myght not helpe hymselfe. So that he sent in his name Vter his broder with a power to helpe wales / & thyderwarde he went as moche as he myght. The kyng of Irlonde and Passent had herde tell that Aurilambros was seke / and to them there came a sarasyn y
t
 was called Coppa / and sayd. Syr dwell ye here all in peas w
t
 your hoost / & I behyght you through my queyntyse y
t
 I shall slee the kynge Aurilambros that is seke. Than sayd Passent / yf ye do so I shall rychely aua
i
e you. This traytour Coppa put vpon hym an habyte of relygyon / & let shaue hym a brode crowne / & came vnto the kynges courte / & sayd that he wolde helpe y
e
 kyng of his malady. Than sayd the traytour Coppa vnto y
e
 kynge. Syr be of good conforte / for I shall gyue you suche a medycyne y
t
 ye shall swete anone ryght and lyst to slepe & haue good rest. And y
e
 traytour gaue hym suche poyson to slepe / that anone ryght in his slepyng he dyed / & the traytour sayd y
t
 he wolde go out in to y
e
 felde tyll he were awaked And so escaped he away / for no man had to hym suspeccyon for bycause of his ha byte that he was clothed in / and also for his brode shauen crowne. But whan the kynges men wyst y
t
 he was deed / they became wonders sory / & fast sought the traytour / but they myght not fynde hȳ. For that traytour returned agayne vn∣to the hoost fro whens he came.






¶ Whan Aurilambros was deed / a sterre on y
e
 morow was seen w
t
 a clere lyght / & at y
t
 bought of the beme was seen the heed of an horryble dragon.


WHan the kyng Aurilābros was thus deed & empoisoned at wyn chestre / on y
e
 morowe after that he was deed aboute the tyme of pryme there was seen a sterre grete & clere / & y
e
 beme of y
e
 sterre was bryghter than the soune / & at the bought of the beme appe red a dragons heed / & out of his mouth came two huge lyghtes that were as bryght as ony fyre brennynge / & the one beme toward fraūce & streyght ouer the see thyderwarde / & out of y
e
 beme came vij. bemes full clere & longe as it were y
e
 lyght fyre. This sterre was seen of ma∣ny a man / but none of them wyst what it betokened. Vter that was kyng Auri lambros broder y
t
 was in Wales with his hoost of Brytons sawe that sterre / & the grete light that it gaue / he wondred therof gretly what it myght betoken / & let call Merlyn / & prayed hym for to tell what it myght betoken.






¶ Of the betokenynge of the sterre.


MErlyn sawe that sterre & behelde it longe tyme / & sythen he quoke and wept tenderly / and sayd. Alas alas that so noble a kynge and so worthy is deed. And I do you to vnderstande that Aurilābros your broder is empoysoned and that I se well in this sterre / & your selfe is betokened by the heed of the dra∣gon that is seen at the bought of y
e
 beme that is your selfe that shall be kyng and regne. And by y
e
 beme y
t
 stādeth toward the eest is vnderstande that ye shall gete a sone that shall conquere all Fraunce / & all the londes y
t
 belongeth to the crowne of fraūce / that shall be a worthyer kyng and of more honour than euer was ony of his aunceters. And by the beme that stretcheth toward Irlonde is betokened that ye shall haue a doughter that shall be quene of Irlonde. And the .vij. bemes betoken that ye shall haue .vij. sones / & euery one of them shall be kynge / & shall regne with moch honour. And abyde ye


no longer here / but go & gyue batayle to your enemyes / & fyght w
t
 them boldly / for ye shal ouercome them & haue y
e
 victo ry. Vter thāked Merlyn hertely / & toke his men & went towarde his enemyes / & they fought togyder mortally / & so he discomfyted his enemyes and destroyed them / & hymselfe slewe Passent y
t
 was Vortigers sone. And his Britons slewe Guillomer that was kynge of Irlonde and all his men. And Vter anone after y
e
 batayle toke his waye towarde Wyn∣thestre for to do bury kynge Aurilābros that was his broder. But thā was the body borne to Stonehenge with moche honour / that he had do make in remem braūce of the Brytons that there were slayne through treason of Engyst / that same daye that they sholde haue ben ac∣corded / and in y
e
 same place they buryed Aurylambros / the seconde yere of his regne with all the worship that myght belonge vnto suche a kynge. On Whose soule god haue mercy. Amen.






¶ Of Vter pendragon / & wherfore he was called so ye shall here. And how he was ouertaken w
t
 the loue of Igreyne y
t
 was the erles wyfe of Cornewayle.


AFter the dethe of Aurilambros Vter his broder was crowned & regned worthely. And i remembraūce of the dragon that he was likened to / he let make two dragons through coūseyle of his Britons / & made that one for to be borne before hym whā he went in to ba tayle / & that other for to abyde at Wyn∣chestre in the bysshops chirche. And for that cause he was called euer after Vter pendragon. And Otta y
t
 was Engistes sone cōmended Vter but lytell that was made newe king / & agaynst hym began to moue warre / & ordeyned a grete com∣pany of his frendes / & of his kynne / & of Ossa his broder / & had taken all y
e
 londe from Humber vnto Yorke. But those of Yorke helde strongly agaynst them / and wold not suffre them to come in to y
e
 cite neyther to yelde y
e
 cite to them / & he be∣syeged the towne anone ryght / & gaue therto a strōge assaute / but they of y
t
 cite kepte them well & strongly. And whan Vter herde therof / he came thyder w
t
 a grete power for to helpe and rescow the cite / & put awaye the syege and gaue a stronge batayle / & Otta & his company defended them as well as they myght. But at y
e
 last they were discōfyted / & the moost parte of them slayne / and Otta & Ossa were taken & put in prison at Lon don. And Vter hȳselfe dwelled a whyle at Yorke / & after he went to Londe. And at Eester after he wolde bere crowne / & holde a solem
ne feest / and let somon all his erles & barons / that they shold come to that feest / & all those that had wyues shold brynge them also to y
e
 
eest. And all came at the kynges cōmaundement as they were commaūded. The feest was rychely arayed & holden / & all worthely set to meet after that they were of estate So y
t
 the erle Gorloys of Corne wayle & Igreyne his wyfe sate nexte to y
e
 kynge And whan the kynge sawe the fayrnes of that lady that she had / anone he was rauysshed for her beaute / & ofre he made to her nyce countenaūce in lokynge and laughynge. So at the last the erle per∣ceyued the preuy lokynge & laughynge and the loue bytwene them / and rose up from y
e
 table in wrath / & toke his wyfe / and called to hym his knightes / & went thens all in wrath w
t
out takyng leue of the kynge. The kynge anone sent after hym that he sholde come agayn & go not thens in despyte of hȳ. And y
e
 erle wolde not come agayne in no maner of wyse. Wherfore the kynge was full wroth / & in wrath hym defyed as his deedly cu
∣my.


And y
e
 erle went thens in to Corne∣wayle with his wyfe in to the castell of Tyntagell. And the kynge let ordeyne a grete hoost & came in to Cornewayle for to destroye the erle yf he myght. But he had put hym in y
•
 stronge castell of Tyn tagell y
t
 was well arayed / & wolde not yelde hym to y
e
 kyng. And y
e
 kyng anone besyeged the castell / & there dwelled .xv. days & might not spede / & euer thought vpon Igreyne / & vpon her layde so mo∣che loue / that he wyst not what to do. So at y
•
 last he called to hym a knyght y
t
 was called Vlfin that was preuy with hym / & tolde hȳ all his coūseyle / & asked of hym what was best to do. Syr sayd he / sende after Merlyn anone / for he can tell you the best coūseyle of ony man ly∣uynge. Merlyn anone was sent after & came to y
e
 kyng. And the kyng told hym all his coūseyle and his wyll. Syr sayd Merlyn / I shall do so moche through y
e
 crafte that I can / that I shal make you come to nyght in y
e
 castell of Tyntagell / & shall haue all your wyll of that lady.






¶ How kyng Vter begate on Igreyne that was the erles wyfe of Corneway∣le Arthur kynge.


MErlyn through crafte y
t
 he coude chaunged y
•
 kynges fygure in to the lykenes of the erle / & Vlfin Garloys his chamberleyn in to y
e
 fygure of Ior∣dan that was y
•
 erles chamberleyn / so y
•
 eche of them was trāsfigured to others lykenes. And whan Merlin had so done he sayd to the kynge. Syr sayd he / now may ye go sodeynly to y
e
 castell of Tyn∣tagell / & aske entre there and haue your wyll. The kyng toke pryuely all y
e
 hoost to gouerne and lede to a knyght that he moche loued / & toke his waye towarde the castell / & with hym toke Vlfyn his chamberlayne and Merlyn. And whan they came thyder / y
•
 porter wende it had ben his owne lord. And whā tyme came for to go to bedde / y
•
 kyng went to bedde with Igreyne the erles wyfe / and dyd with her all his wyl / & begate vpon her a sone whiche was called Arthur. And on the morowe y
e
 kyng toke his leue of y
e
 lady and went agayn to his hoost. And the same nyght that the kynge laye by Igreyne in bedde y
t
 was the erles wyfe the kynges men gaue a grete assaute to the castel. And the erle & his men manly defended them. But at the last it befel so that in the same assaute the erle hȳselfe was slayne & the castell taken. And the kyng anone returned agayn to Tynta∣gell and spoused Igreyne with moche honour and made her quene. And soone after that the tyme came y
•
 she sholde be delyuered & had a sone whiche was cal¦led Arthur. And after that gate on her a doughter that was called Amya. And whan she was of age a noble baron that was called Aloth y
•
 was lorde of Leons wedded her. ¶ Whan Vter longe tyme had regned there came vpon hȳ a grete sekenes as it were a sorowe. And in the meane tyme those that had in kepynge Otta that was Engistes sone and Ossa his broder that than were in pryson / they let them goo for grete gyftes that they gaue / and wente with them. And whan these two bretherne were escaped & came agayne in to theyr owne coūtree they ordeyned a grete power of folke / & began to warre agayn vpon the kyng.






¶ How kynge Vter chose Aloth to kepe the londe of Brytayne whyle y
t
 he was seke / for as moche as he myght not for his sekenes.


ANd for as moche as kyng Vter was seke & myght not helpe hȳ selfe / he ordeyned Aloth sone of Eleyne that than was chosen for to be wardeyn


and 
heftayne of all his folke. And so he anone & his Brytons assembled a grete hoost / & gaue batayle to Otta and to his folke / but Otta at the last was discom∣fyted. ¶ It be fell thus after warde that these brytons had indignacyon of Aloth & wolde not be to hym attendaūt / wher fore y
•
 kynge was wonders fore anoyed and let put hym in a lyttet is the hoost amonge his folke. And they ladde hym to Vero
oin that than was a fayre cite / where as saynt Albon was martyred / and after was that cite destroyed with paynyms & through warre / and thyder they had sent Otta & Ossa & theyr peo∣ple & entred in to y
e
 towne & let make fast the gates / & there they helde them. And the king came & besyeged them / & made a stronge assaute. But they y
•
 were win manly defended them. The kyng let or∣deyn his gōnes & his engynes for to bre¦ke y
•
 walles / & y
•
 walles were so strōge y
•
 no thynge myght misdo thē. Otta & his people had grete despite y
•
 a kyng lyenge in a lytter had besteged them / & toke coū seyle to come out on y
e
 morow & gyue ba¦tayle to y
e
 king / & in that batayle Otta & Ossa were slayne / & al y
e
 other alyue fled in to Scotlonde / & made Colegrin theyr cheftayne. And y
e
 saxons y
•
 were escaped brought agayn a grete strength / & sayd amonge them / yf kyng Vter were deed they shold well cōquere y
e
 lōd / & thought to poyson hȳ / & ordeyned men to do this dede: gyuyng them grete gyftes / & they went thyderward in poore mēnes wede to accomplysshe theyr fals purpose / but it auayled not / for they myght not come nygh y
•
 kyng. Tyll at y
e
 last they espyed that y
e
 kyng drāke none other ly
our but water of a clere well y
•
 was nigh besyde & these traytours on a day priuely went to y
e
 well & put therin poyson so y
t
 al the water was poysoned / & anone after a
 the kyng had dronken of y
•
 water / he be∣gan to swell / & soone after dyed / & as ma¦ny as dranke of y
•
 water dyed also. And anone as this was espyed / folke of the towne let stop y
•
 well for euermore. Whā the kyng was deed / his folke bare hȳ to Stonehenge w
t
 grete solempnite of bys∣shops & barons y
•
 were there to bury hȳ besyde Aurilambros his broder / & after returned agayn euerythone / & sent after Arthur his sone: & they made hym king of the londe with moche reuerence after his faders deth .xvij. yere of his regne.






¶ How Arthur y
t
 was the sone of Vte
 was crowned after his faders dethe / & how he droue out of this londe Coleg
 & the saxons / & Cheldrik of Aimayne.






WHan Arthur was made kynge of the londe he was but yonge of .xv. yere of age / but he was fayre and bolde and doughty of body / & to meke folke he was good and curteys and large of spendynge / and made hym wondersly well beloued among all men where it was nede. And whā he began to regne he sware that the saxons neuer


showe haue peas ne test tyll he had dry∣uen them out of the londe / & assembled a grete hoost & fought with Colegrin / the whiche after the tyme y
•
 Otta was deed the saxons maynteyned. And this Cole∣grin was discōfyted & fledde vnto yorke & toke the cite / & there helde hym. And y
e
 kynge besyeged hym there / but he gate no thynge / it was so stronge / & y
•
 cite de∣fended it manly. In y
•
 meane tyme Cole grin left y
•
 cyte to Bladud & fled hymself to Cheldrik that was kyng of Almayne for to haue socour of hym. And he assem¦bled a grete power & arryued in scotlond with .v .C. shyppes. And whan Arthur wyst of these tydynges / & sawe he had not folk ynough to fyght w
t
 Cheldrik / he lefte y
e
 syege & went to London / & sent a∣none lettres to Howell of lytell Brytayn his neuewe his systers sone / y
t
 he sholde come to hym w
t
 all y
e
 power y
t
 he myght. And he assembled a grete host & arryued at southampton / where king Arthur re¦ceyued hym Ioyously w
t
 moche honour. And those two hostes mette & assembled them / & toke theyr waye to Nichol that Cheldrik had besyeged / but it was not taken. And they came vpon Cheldrik & his people or they wist where that they were / & assayled thē egerly. Kyng Chel¦drik & his men defended them manly to theyr power. But kyng Arthur and his men slewe so many saxons y
•
 neuer was seen such slaughter. And Cheldrik & his men y
t
 were left alyue fledde away / and kyng Arthur pursued them & droue thē out in to a wode y
t
 they myght no ferder passe. Cheldrik & his mē sawe well that they were brought in to grete disease / & yelded them to kyng Arthur in this ma¦ner wise / that he shold take theyr horses & harneys & all y
t
 they had / & they 
wold
 onely go on fote in to theyr shyppes / & so they 
wold
 go home in to theyr own lōde and neuer come agayn in to this londe. And vpon assuraūce of this thynge they gaue hym good host ages. And Arthur by counseyle of his men graunted this thynge / and receyued the hostages / and thervpon y
e
 saxons went to theyr shyp∣pes. And whan they were in the hye see the wynde chaūged as y
e
 deuyll it wold and they turned theyr nauy and came agayne in to this londe and arryued at Cotnes / & went out of the shypp
 and toke the loude / and clene robbed it / and slewe moche people / and toke all the ar∣mure that they myght fynde / & so they went forth tyll they came vnto Bathe. But the men of y
•
 towne shette fast theyr gates / & wolde not suffre them to come within the towne / & they defended them well and manly agaynst them.






¶ How king Arthur gaue batayle vnto the sarons whan they came agayne in to this londe / & had besyeged the towne of Bathe / and ouercame them.


WHan kyng Arthur herde these ty∣dynges / he anone let hange the hostages / & lefte Howell of Brytayn his neuewe for to kepe the marche to warde Scotlond with halfe his people / & hym¦selfe went to helpe & rescowe y
e
 towne of Bathe. Whan he came thyder he gaue a stronge batayle to Cheldrik / & slewe al¦moost all y
e
 people y
t
 he had. For no man myght w
t
stande hym ne endure vnder y
e
 stroke of his swerde / & there were slayne bothe Colegrin and Bladud his broder / and Cheldrik fledde thens & 
wold
 haue gone to his shyppes. But whan kynge Arthur wyst it / he toke .x. M. knyghtes to Cador that was erle of Cornewayle for to let & stop his passage. And Arthur hymselfe went toward y
•
 marche of scot londe / for messengers told hym that the scottes had besyeged Howell of Britayn there as he
ay seke / & therfore he hasted


hym thyderwarde. And Cador pursued after Cheldrik / & toke hym or he myght come to his shyppes / & slewe hym & his people. Whan Cador had done this via∣ge / he hasted hym agayne towarde Ar∣thur as fast as he myght / & foūde hym in Scotlonde / where he had rescowed Howell of Brytayne. But the Scottes were ferre within Mountef / and there they helde them a whyle / but Arthur pursued them / & they fledde thens in to Limoigne / there were in that coūtre .lx. yles / & grete plente of byrdes & Egles y
•
 were wont to crye & fyght togyder and make grete noyse whan folke came to robbe that londe / and warne as moche as they myght / and so they dyd / for the Scottes were so grete rauenours / that they toke all that they myght fynde in the londe of Limoigne without ony spa¦rynge / & therwith charged agayne the folke for to go in to Scotlonde.






¶ How kynge Arthur asked of Merlyn the aduentures of .vj. of the last kynges that were to regne in Englonde / & how the londe sholde ende.


SIr sayd Merlyn / in y
•
 yere of the incarnacyon of Iesu Chryst. M .CC .xv. shall come a lambe out of Wyn∣thestre that shall haue a whyte tongue & true lyppes / & he shall haue wryten in his hert holynes. This lambe shall ma∣ke many goddes houses / & he shall haue peas y
e
 moost parte of his lyfe / & he shall make one of y
e
 fayrest places of y
e
 worlde that in his tyme shall not fully be made an ende of. And in the ende of his lyfe a wolfe of a straūge londe shall do hȳ mo∣che harme & sorowe through warre / but at y
e
 lābe shall be mayster through helpe of a reed foxe that shall come out of the north west / & shall ouercome hym / & the wolfe shall dye in water. And after that tyme the lambe shal lyue no whyle but shal dye. His seed shal be in a straūge londe. And the londe shall be without a gouernour a lytell tyme.


ANd after this tyme shall come a dragon medled with mercy and also with woodnes / and he shall haue a berde as a gote / that shall gyue in Eng∣londe a shadowe / and shall kep
 the lond from colde & hete / and his one fote shall be set in wyke / and that other in Lon∣don / & he shall embrace in habytacyons And he shall open his mouth towarde wales / & the tremblynge of the hydour of his mouth his eeres shall stretche to∣warde many haby
acyons & countrees & his breth shall be full swete in straūge londe. And in his tyme shall the ryuers renne blode & with brayne. And he shall make in places of his londe walles that shall do moche harme vnto his seed af∣ter his tyme. And than shall there come a people out of the Northwest durynge his regne / that shall be ladde through a wycked hare / that the dragon shall do crowne kyng / that afterwarde shall flee ouer the see / without comynge agayne for drede of y
e
 dragon. And in that tyme the sonne shall be as reed as blode that men shall se through out all the worlde / that shall betoken grete pestylence and deth of folke / through dynt of swerde & that people shall be faderles tyll y
•
 tyme that y
e
 dragon dye through an hare that shal m
ue warre agaynst hym vnto the ende of his lyf / that shall not fully be en∣ded in his tyme. This dragon shall be∣holde in his tyme the best body of the worlde / and he shall dye besyde the mar¦ches of a straūge londe / & the londe shall dwell faderles without a good gouer∣nour / and men shall wepe for his deth from the yle of Shepey vnto the hauen of Mar
yl / wherfore alas shall be theyr


songe of faderlesse folke / that shall ouer lyue in his londe destroyed.


ANd after this dragon shall come a gote out of Kar that shall haue hornes and a berde of syluer / and there shal come out of his nosethrilles a domp that shall betoken hungre & sorowe and grete dethe of the people. And moche of his londe in y
•
 begynnynge of his regne shall be wasted. This gote shall go ouer in to Fraūce / & shall open y
•
 floure of his lyfe & deth. In his tyme there shal aryse an Egle in Cornewayle that shall haue fethers of golde / that of pryde shall be w
t
 out pere of the londe / & he shall despyse lordes of blode. And after he shal flee sha¦mefully by a bere at Gauerscch. And af¦ter shal be made brydges of men vpon y
•
 costes of the see / & stones shall fall from castelles / & many other townes shall be made playne. In this tyme shall seme y
t
 the bere shall brenne / & a batayle shall be done vpon y
•
 armes of y
•
 see in a felde or∣deined as a shelde / & at that batayle shal dye many whyte hedes / wherfore this batayle shall be called y
•
 whyte batayle. And the foresayd bere shall do this gote moche harme / & it shall come out of the south west & of his blode. Than shal the gote lese moche of his londe / tyll y
•
 tyme that shendshyp shall ouercome hȳ. And than shall he clothe hym in a lyons skyn & than shall he wynne that he had lost & more therto. For a people shall come out of the northwest y
•
 shall make the gote so sore aferde y
t
 he shall be in grete {per}plexite And he shall auenge hȳ on his enemyes by the counseyle of two owles that fyrst shall be in peryll for to be vndone. But y
•
 olde owle shall go away a certayn tyme and after he shall come agayn in to this lōde. These two owles shall do grete har¦me to many one / & so they shal coūseyle y

 gote to arere warre agaynst y

 foresayd bere. And at the last the gote & y
•
 owles shall come at Burton vpō Trent / & shall go ouer / & for drede the bere shall flee & a swan w

t
 his hoost.






¶ How kyng Arthur fought w
t
 Guillo∣mer & ouercame hym. And how y
e
 scot∣tes became his men.








WHan Guillomer that was kyng of Irlonde herde tydinges that king Arthur was entred at Gla¦stenbury / he ordeyned a grete power of Irysshmen & came to y
•
 see w
t
 them / & so came in to scotlond ouer y

 see / & arryued fast by there as king Arthur was w
t
 his hoost. And anone as he wyst therof / he went towardes hym & gaue hȳ batayle & ouercame hym. And Guillomer fled w
t
 his men agayn in to Irlonde. And whā this was done / Arthur returned agayn in to y
•
 place where he had lefte y
•
 scottes & wold haue slayne them all. But y
•
 bys∣shops / abbots & other folke of y
•
 coūtre & ladyes open heded come before kyng Ar¦thur & cryed hȳ mercy / sayenge. Gentyl kyng as ye are a mayntayner of christē∣dom / haue pite on vs your euen chrystē / for by our deth ye gete no worship / as to slee chrystē folke / & therfore haue mercy on vs / for we haue had moche sorowe by the Saxons y
•
 haue passed through our countree / but y
•
 is not ynough to you / for they haue taken our castels & slayne out beestes & eten / & moch harme haue done vs / & yf ye slee vs cryenge you mercy / it sholde be grete dyshonour to you. For ye haue done ynough to vs / & haue ouerco∣mē vs / & for goddes loue suffre vs to lyue & haue mercy on chrystē people y
•
 byleue in Chryst as ye do. Whan kyng Arthur herd this sorowe / he had pite on them / & gaue them lyf & lymme w
t
out ony more harme / & they fell down to his feet & thā¦ked hym / & became his lyege men / & he toke of them homage. And after y
•
 kyng Arthur turned agayn w
t
 his host & came to yorke / & there abode duryng y
•
 vyage. And than gaue he al Logres to Aloth y
t
 had spoused his syster / & plente of other gyftes. Thā was Gawen his cosyn but yōge of age. To al his men y
•
 had serued hym in his warre he gaue ryche gyftes thankynge them of theyr good seruyce.






¶ How kyng Arthur spoused Gue∣neuer y
•
 erles cosyn of Cornewayle / and after he conquered all Irlonde.


WHan kynge Arthur had brought his londe in peas & rest & in good state / and all was well in euery coūtree. Thā toke he & wedded a wyfe y
•
 was cal¦led Gueneuer / & made her quene / a fayre lady & a gentyl / y
•
 Cador y
•
 erle of Corne∣wayle had nourysshed in his chambre y
t
 was his cosyn. But neuer they had chil¦drē togyder / & neuertheles king Arthur loued her full well. And anone as wyn∣ter was past / he let assemble a grete host and all his barons / & sayd that he 
wold
 go in to Irlonde for to conquere y
•
 londe. And he taryed not longe y
•
 he ne passed ouer in to Irlōde. And Guillomer y
•
 king let assemble a grete host / & gaue batayle to kynge Arthur. But Guillomer was discōfyted and yelded hym to the kynge & became his man / & to hym dyd feaute & homage / & of hym helde all that londe


fro that tyme forward. And after passed kyng Arthur ferthermore and cōquered Gutlonde & Islonde / & toke homage of y
•
 folke of the londe / and there dwelled .xij. yere in peas / and regned with ioye and myrth / & there warred no man nor wo∣man vpon hym. And he became so cur∣teys & large & honourable / that the em∣perours courte of Rome / ne none other through out all y
•
 worlde was not accoū¦ted to kyng Arthur y
•
 ony man wyst of / nor none so well praysed. And therfore y
•
 best knyghtes of all maner londes came vnto hym there for to dwell. And he re∣ceyued them w
t
 good wyll & reuerence. And all the knyghtes were so good that no man knewe the werst. And therfore kynge Arthur made a roūde table / that whan they sholde syt at theyr meet / all sholde be lyke hye & euenly serued at the table / y
t
 none of them sholde make vaunt that one were hyer than an other. And kyng Arthur had at that table brytons & frenshmen / normās & flemynges / bur gonyons / mausers & lotherins / & of all the londes on this halfe the moūt Gorye and of his londe of grete Brytayne / & of Cornewayle / of Wales / & of Irlonde / & of Scotlond / and shortly to tell of all the londes that wolde worshyp cheualrye suche came to kynge Arthurs courte.






¶ How kyng Arthur went in to fraūce & conquered the londe of Froll that was a Romayne / & how he slewe hym.


SIth it befell that kynge Arthur through coūseyle of his barons & lordes wolde go to conquere all Fraunce that than was called Galle through Ro¦mayns that than helde y
•
 londe in theyr power & in theyr gouernaūce. And y
•
 Ro∣mayns had taken that londe to a noble knyght and a worthy of body that was called Froll. And whan he wyst y
•
 kyng Arthur came / he ordeyned an hoost of a grete power / & fought with the kynge / And he & his folke were dyscomfyted / & fledde vnto Parys & entred the cite / and closed the gates / and there helde hym. Whā Arthur wyst that Froll was gone to Parys / he pursued after & came thy∣der & besyeged hym. But the cite was stronge & well arayed / & they that were therin defended them well and manly. Kynge Arthur dwelled there more than a moneth / & there was so moche people in the cite y
•
 they dispended all theyr vy∣tayles y
•
 they had w
t
in: & so grete hunger became amonge them y
•
 they dyed won¦ders thycke within y
•
 cite for hunger / & came vnto Froll / & prayed hym to be ac∣corded w
t
 kyng Arthur for to haue peas and they wolde yelde them vnto hym & the cite also. Froll saw that he might no longer holde the cite agaynst theyr wyll & trusted gretly vpon his owne strength & sent to kynge Arthur y
•
 he sholde come fyght w
t
 hym body for body / & so sholde they departe fraūce bytwene them two. Kyng Arthur anone graūted it / & 
 not that none of his people vndertoke y
•
 batayle for hym. And on y
•
 
orow bothe came well arayed w
t
out Parys / where as they shold fyght. And anone togyder they smote so fyersly / and so well they fought on bothe sydes / y
•
 no man coude deme the better of them. And so it befell that Froll gaue Arthur suche a stroke y
•
 he kneled to the groūde wheder he wold or not / & as Froll withdrewe his 
erde he woūded kyng Arthur in the foreheed that y
•
 blode fell downe by his eyen & his face. Arthur anone sterte vp egerly whā he felte hȳselfe hurte as a man y
•
 semed almoost wood / & he toke Tabourne his good swerde & drewe it vp on hygh / and gaue Froll suche a stroke y
•
 therwith he claue his heed downe to y
•
 sholders / so y
•
 his heline myght not be his warent / &


so he fell down deed in y
e
 place. And than they of y
e
 cite made grete sorow for Froll And euerychone yelded them vnto kyng Arthur / & the towne also / & became his men / & dyd to hȳ homage & feaute. And he receyued them / & toke of them good hostages. And kynge Arthur after that went forth w
t
 his host & cō
uered Angeo & Angiers / Gascoin / Poytou / Nauerne & Burgoyn / Berry / Lotherin / Turin / & Poytiers / & all y
e
 other londes of fraūce he conquered holly. And whā he had all conquered & taken homage & feaute / he 
turned agayn to Parys / & there dwel∣led he longe tyme / & ordeyned peas lōge tyme ouer all y
e
 coūtree & through out all fraūce. And whan peas was made ouer all through his noble knyghthode y
t
 he had / & also for his own worthynes. And no man were he neuer so grete a lorde durst not meue warre agaynst hym ney¦ther to aryse to make the londe of fraūce vnquyete. And in peas he dwelled there ix. yere / & did many grete wonders / & re proued many proude men & yll tyraūtes 
 chastised them after theyr deseruyng.






¶ How kyng Arthur auaunted all his men that had trauayled in his seruyce.


Nd afterwarde it befell thus at eester there as he helde a feest at Parys / & rychely he begā to auaūce his knightes for theyr seruice that they had holpen hym in his conquest. He gaue to his stewarde y

And whan Arthur had thus feffed his knyghtes / at Apryl nexte after folowynge he came agayn in to Britayn his owne londe / and after at whytsontyde nexte folowynge by coun∣seyle of his barons he wol

y ally serued than the emperour of Rome or ony other kyng lyuynge in y
e
 worlde. And whan the emperour had ouers

u∣led after hym / he let assemble & ordeyne a grete hoost for to destroye kynge Ar∣thur yf that he myght. And kynge Ar∣thur as touchyng his power and party ordeyned his power & knyghtes of the rounde table.






¶ Of the kynges and lordes that came for to helpe kynge Arthur a∣gaynst the emperour.




He kyng of Scotlond / of Irlond of Gutlonde / of Denmarke / & of Almayne / eche of them had .x. M. me

Howell of brytayn had .xij. thousande / & himselfe of his owne londe xij. thousand. And of arbalastres and of archers & of other folke on fote / that no man coude nombre them. And whan all were redy for to go / kynge Arthur toke his londe & Gueneuer his wyfe to kepe to one of his neuewes that was a wyse knight and a hardy whiche was called Mordred / but he was not all true / as ye shall here afterwarde. Kynge Arthur toke all his realme to this Mordred / sa∣ue onely the crowne. And after y
t
 kynge Arthur toke his hoost & went to South hamton where that the shyppes were brought & the folke assembled / and they went vnto the see / and had wynde and weder at wyll. And as soone as they myght they arryued at Ha

¶ How kyng Arthur fought w
t
 a gyaūt in Spayne that was called Dinabus y
t
 slewe Eleyue that was kynge Howels cosyn of lytell Brytayne.


BYnge Arthur had not dwelled in the coūtree but a lytell tyme that men tolde hym that there was comen a grete gyaunte in to Spayne / and had rauysshed fayre Eleyne that was cosyn vnto Howell of lytell Brytayn / and had brought her vpon an hyll that is called the moūt of saynt Bernarde / and there was no man in that coūtree so bolde nor so hardy that durst fyght with hym / ne come nye the place where as the gyaūt dwelled that was called Dinabus / and moche sorowe he dyd in that countree. Whan kyng Arthur herde these tydyn∣ges / he called to hym Kay & Bedewere and cōmaunded them for to go pryuely and espye where the gyaunt myght be foūde. And they came to y
e
 ryuage there as men sholde go to the moūt that was all enclosed aboute with water / & yet is and euer shall be. And they sawe a bren∣nynge fyre vpon y
e
 hyll. And there was also an other hyll nye that / & there was vpon that an other fyre brēnynge. Kay and Bedewere came to the nexte hyll / & founde a wydowe open heded / syttynge besyde a tombe sore wepyng / and made grete sorow / & ofte she sayd Eleyn Eleyn And Kay & Bedewere asked what she was / and wherfore she made so moche sorow / & who lay in that tombe. O sayd she / what sorowe & mysauenture fayre lordes seke ye here / for yf y
e
 gyaunt may fynde you here / he wyll slee you anone. Be styll good wyfe sayd they / therof dis∣may you not / but tell vs the sothe why that thou makest so moche sorowe and wepynge. Syrs sayd she / for a damoy∣sell that I nourysshed with my brestes that was called Eleyn / that was cosyn to Howell of Brytayn. And here lyeth y
e
 body in this tombe whiche to me was taken to nourysshe. And so there came a deuyll a gyaunt and rauysshed her / and me also / and ladde vs bothe with hym away. And he wolde haue forlayn that mayde that was so yonge and tender of age / but she myght not suffre it / so grete and so huge as the gyaūt was. And for certayne yf he come now as he is wont to do / he wyll you now bothe 
lee / & ther fore go ye hens. Than spake these two messengers and sayd to her / wherfore go ye not frō hens. Certes syrs sayd she whan that Eleyn was deed / the gya
 made me to abyde to do and haunte his


wyll / 
 I must it 
 suffre / & god it w
teth I do it not with my wyll / for I had 
euer to be deed than to deale w
t
 him so moche payne & sorowe I haue whan he me forlyeth. Whan Kay & Bedewere had herde all y
t
 this woman tolde them they returned agayne & came to kynge Arthur / & tolde hym all y
t
 they had seen & herde. Arthur anone toke them bothe with hym and went pryuely by nyght that none of his hoost wyst / & came on y
e
 morow erly to y
e
 gyaūt & faught w
t
 hym strongly / & at y
e
 last slewe hym. And Ar∣thur 
ad Bedewere to smyte of his heed & brynge it in to the hoost to shewe it for a wonder / for it was so grete and huge. Whan they came agayn to y
e
 hoste / they told wherfore they had bē out / & shewed to them the heed. And euery man was glad & ioyfull of the worthy dede y
t
 kyng Arthur had done that was theyr lorde. And Howell was full sorowfull for his cosyn that was so lost. And after warde whan he had space he let make a fayre chapell of our lady ouer Eleyns tombe.






¶ How kynge Arthur gaue batayle to the emperour / in y
e
 whiche batayle the emperour was slayne.


ARthur & his people had tydyn∣ges that y
e
 emperour had assem∣bled a grete power / as well of sarasyns as of paynyms & chrysten men / wherof the nōbre was .lxxx. M. hors men / with fote men. Arthur & his people ordeyned fast forth in theyr waye toward y
e
 empe rour & passed Normandy & Fraūce vnto Burgoyn / & wolde haue gone to y
e
 hoost For men tolde hym that the emperours hoost wolde come to Lucie. The empe∣rour & his hoost in y
e
 begynnynge of Au∣gust remeued from Rome / & came forth ryght the waye towarde y
e
 hoost. Than came kyng Arthurs espyes & sayd / yf y
t
 Arthur wolde he sholde fynde the empe¦rour there fast by / but they sayd that y
e
 emperour had so grete power w
t
 hym of kynges of the londe of paynyms / & also chrysten people / that it were but foly to kyng Arthur to mete with them. For y
e
 spyes tolde that the emperour had fyue or syxe men agaynst one of his. Kynge Arthur was bolde & hardy / and for no thynge hym dysmayed & sayd. Go we boldly in goddes name agaynst the Ro∣mayns that with them lede sarasyns & paynyms / that haue no maner trust in god / but onely vpon theyr strength. Go we now & seke them sharply in y
e
 name of almyghty god / & slee we y
e
 paynyms & chrysten men y
t
 be agaynst vs w
t
 them for to destroye chrysten men / & god shall helpe vs to ouercome them / for we haue the ryght opynyon / & therfore haue we trust in god / & do we so that y
e
 enemyes that be to chrystendom & to god may be destroyed & ouercomen / & that men may recorde the worthynes of knyghthode. Whā kyng Arthur had thus sayd / they cryed all w
t
 an hye voyce. God y
t
 is fader almyghty worshypped be thy name w
t
∣out ende. amē. And graūt vs grace well for to do / & to destroye our enemyes that be agaynst chrystendome. In the name of y

e
 holy ghost. amē. And god gyue hym neuer grace n
 wor∣shyp in the worlde / ne mercy of hym to haue / that this daye shall feynt well for to smite & egerly. And so they rode softly & ordeyned theyr wynges wel & wysely The emperour herde t
ll that kyng Ar∣thur & his folke were redy apparaylled for to fyght with him / & how they were comynge / he let ordeyue his wynges in the best maner y
t
 he coud / & more trusted in his strength than in almyghty god / & that was seen afterwarde. For whan y
e
 two hostes mette / the emperour lost. iiij of his men agaynst ou
 of Arthurs / & so


many were slayne what on y
e
 one party & what on that other / that it was grete pyte to wyte & beholde. In this batayle were slayne through kyng Arthurs .v. kynges of the paynyms & of other won∣ders moche people. And kyng Arthurs men fought so wel that the Romayns & paynyms had no more strength to with stande them than .xx. shepe agaynst .v. wolues. And so it befel y
t
 in this batayle in the shoure that was wonders hard & longe duryng on that one syde & on that other / the emperour among them there was slayne / but there was no man that wyst for very sothe who hym slewe.






¶ How king Arthur let bury his lordes & knyghtes that he had lost in y
e
 batayle and how he sent the emperours body to Rome that there was slayne in batayle.


WHan the romayns wyst that the emperour was deed / they for so∣ke the felde / & the paynyms also And kyng Arthur chaced after them tyl it was nyght / & so many of them slewe that it was wonder to tell. And whā it was nyght kyng Arthur turned agayn & thanked god of his victory. And on the morowe he let loke & serche all the felde for his knyghtes y
t
 he there lost / that is to saye Borel erle of maunt / Bedewer & kay / & Ligiers erle of Boloyn / Vrgety erle of Baar / Aloth erle of Wynchestre / Cursael erle of Chestre / and Holden erle of Flaūdres. These were y
e
 grete lordes that king Arthur lost in y
t
 batayle with other worthy knyghtes amonge them. And some he let bury in abbays by the coūtree / some he let be borne into theyr owne coūtree. And the emperours body he let take & put vpon a bere / & sent it to Rome / & sent to saye the Romayns that for Brytayn & Fraūce whiche he helde / other truage wolde he none paye. And yf they asked hym ony other truages / ryght suche truage he wold tham paye kyng Arthur let here kay to kenen his owne castell / & there buryed hym. And Ligier was borne to Boloyn where he was lorde. And Holden was borne in to Flaūdres / and there was buryed. And all the other he let bury with moche ho∣nour in abbays & in houses of relygyon in the countree there they were slayne. And kynge Arthur hymselfe soiourned that same yere in Burgoyne with his hoost / & thought y
t
 same yere folowyuge to passe the mount of Ioye / and to haue gone to Rome for to take the cite / and to haue put the Romayns in subieccyon / but the wycked tyraunt Mordred letted hym / as after ye shall here.






¶ How the traytour Mordred to whom kyng Arthur toke his lōde to kept & his castels / & he helde them agaynst hym.


WHan kynge Arthur had taken to Mordred his realme to kepe / and was gone agaynst the emperour of Ro∣me / & was passed y
e
 see / Mordred anone toke homage & feaute of all them y
t
 were in this londe / & wolde haue had the lōde to his owne vse / & toke castels all about and let them be arayed. And after this faisnes he dyd an other grete wronge / for agaynst the lawe of thrystendom he toke his own vncles wife as a traytour and ordeyned hym a grete host agayust kyng Arthurs comyng / to holde y
e
 londe agaynst hym w
t
 strength for euermore / and to slee kyng Arthur yf he myght / & sent by see & by londe / and let assemble paynyms & christen people. And he sent to saxons and to danes for to helpe hym And also Mordred sent to Cheldrik to do men come to hȳ out of saxon / that was a worthy duke / & promised hym yf that he brought with hym moche people he


wolde gra

t
 a grete strength & power of people And Mordred had assembled also on his halfe / that they had .xl. M. of stronge knyghtes whan that they had nede.






¶ How king Arthur chaced y
t
 traytour Mordred / & how he was slayne / & kyng Arthur Wounded to deth.


THese tydynges came to kyng Ar¦thur where as he was in Bur∣guyn / & was therof sore anoyed / & toke all Fraūce to Howell for to kepe w
t
 halfe of his men / & prayed hym to kepe it tyll he came agayn / for he hyselfe wolde go into Britayn / & auenge hym on the fals traytour Mordred / & went his waye & came to whytsand / & toke shyppyng w
t
 his men / & a grete hoost of frenshmen / & arryued at Sandwyche. But or that he myght come to londe w
t
 his people / Mor¦dred was come w
t
 all his power / & gaue a stronge batayle / so y
t
 kyng Arthur lost many a man or he myght come to londe For there was Gawayne his neuewe slayne & Augnissell y
t
 helde Scotlonde / & many other / wherof kyng Arthur was ful sory. But after y
t
 they were comen to lōde / Mordred might not agaynst them endure / but was discōfyted & fled thens the same nyght w
t
 his men / & on the mo∣rowe came to London / but men of y
e
 cite wold not let hȳ entre / & from thens fled to wynehestre / & there helde hym w
t
 his people. Kyng Arthur let take y
e
 body of Gawayn his cosyn / & y
e
 body of Augnis∣sel / & let y
t
 one be borne to scotlond / & that other to Pouer & buried. And after king Arthur toke his waye to destroye Mor∣dred / & he fled thens into Corne Wayle. And the quene Gueneuer y
t
 was kynge Arthurs wyfe y
t
 thā soiourned at yorke herde that Mordred was fled thens / & y
t
 he myght not endure agaynst kyng Ar∣thur / she was sore aferde and had grete doubte / & wyst not what was best to do For she wyst well y
t
 her lorde kynge Ar∣thur wolde neuer of her haue mercy for the grete shame y
t
 she had done hȳ / & to∣ke her waye pryuely with .iiij. men & no mo / & came to Karlyon / & there she dwel¦led all her lyfe / & was neuer seen amōge folke. Kyng Arthur wyst that Mordred was fledde in to Cornewayle / & let send after his men in to Scotlond & Northū∣berlonde vnto Number / and let assemble folke w
t
out nombre & went vnto Corne∣wayle to seke Mordred. And Mordred had assembled to hȳ all y
t
 folke of Corne∣wayle without nōbre / & wyst y
t
 Arthur was comynge / & had leuer to dye & take his chaūce than longer to flee / & abode & gaue an hard batayle to kyng Arthur & his people: so y
t
 there escaped none away on lyue saue kynge Arthur & other that were woūded to deth / for Mordred was slayne & all his people / and all kyng Ar∣thurs noble knyghtes of y
e
 roūde table / wherof it was grete pyte. And king Ar∣thurs made hym to be borne in a lytter to Auyon to be heled of his woundes. And yet y
e
 Brytons suppose y
t
 he lyueth in an other lond / & that he shall come yet & con¦quere all Brytayn. But cer
es this is y
e
 prophecy of Merlyn. He sayd his dethe shold be doubtous / & he sayd trouth. For therof yet men haue doubte / & shal haue for euermore as men saye. For mē wote not whether that he is on lyue or deed. ¶ Arthur was borne to Auyon the. xxii yere of his regne / after the incarnacyon of our lorde Jesu Chryst .v. C .xlvi. yere.






¶ How kynge Arthur delyuered the realme vnto Constantyne the sone of Cador his neuewe.








WHan kyng Arthur wyst that he myght regne no lenger / he let come before hȳ Cōstantyne that was Cadors sone erle of Cornewayl his cosyn / and to hym betoke all his realme byddynge hym to be kynge therof tyll that he came agayne / for as moche as he had none heyre begoten of his body / and grete harme it was / that so noble a kyng and so doughty as he was had no childe of his body begotē. But all thȳge that god wyll haue done / must be done / whose name be blyssed w
t
out ende. amē.






¶ How Constantyne slewe Mordreds two sones that warred vpon hym.


THis Constantyne was a noble & a worthy knyght of body. And y
t
 two sones that Mordred had begoten had grete enuy vnto Constantyne that than was crowned kynge. And so it be∣fell y
t
 they begā to meue warre agaynst hym / & assembled a grete hoost of them that were before with Mordred / & had ben dryuen awaye / whiche dyd moche sorowe through out all the londe. That one broder ordeyned hȳ to go to London for to take the cite / & that other went to wynchestre. But Constantyne came to London and slewe hym that was there And after he wēt to wynch estrē & sleme hym that was there also. And so was he quyte of bothe his enemyes. Whan Cōstantyne had regued well & worthely foure yere he dyed / & lyeth at London.






¶ Of kynge Adclbryghe and of kynge Edell.


AFter kynge Constantynes deth there were two kynges in Bry∣tayne / that one was called Adtlbryght that was a Dane / & he helde the coūtree of Norfolke and Suffolke. That other hyght Edell and was a bryton / and he helde Nicholl / Lyndesey / & all the londe vnto Number. These two kynges fast warred togyder / but they were after ac¦corded / & loued togyder as they had ben borne of one body. The kyng Edell had a syster that was called Orewenne / and he gaue her through grete frendshyp to kynge Adelbryght to wyfe. And kynge Adelbryght begate vpō her a doughter that was called Argentyl. And y
t
 thyrde yere after came vpon hym a straūge se∣kenes that nedes he must dye. And he sent to kynge Edell his broder in lawe that he sholde come & speke with hym / and he came to hym with a good wyll. Than prayed he the kyng and coniured hym also in the name of god / that after whan he were deed / he sholde take his doughter Argentyll & the londe / & kepe and nourysshe her in his chambre. And whan she were of age that he shold ma∣ry her to the strongest & worthyest man that he myght fynde / and than he shold yelde vp her londe agayne. Kyng Edell graunted it / and by othe confermed his prayer. And whā Adelbright was deed & buryed / Edell toke y
t
 damoysell Argen¦tyll / & nourysshen her in his chambre / & she became as fayre as ony myght be.








¶ How kyng Edell maryed the da∣moysell to a knaue of his kerhym.


THis kyng Edell that was vncle to Argent yit / bet hought how he might falsly haue y
e
 londe frō his nece / & falsly agaynst his othe to deceyue y
e
 da∣moysell / & to mary her to a knaue of his kechin y
t
 was called Curan / & he became the worthyest & strongest man of body y
t
 ony man wyst in ony londe lyuyng / & to him he thought shamefully to haue ma¦ryed her for to haue had her londe after∣warde / but he was deceyued. For this Curan was Haueloks sone y
t
 was king of kyrklane in Dēmarke / & this Curan tōquered his wyues londe afterward / & slewe king Edel y
t
 was his wyues vncle & had all her lond / as in an other place it telleth more openly: & he regned but thre yere / for saxons & danes slewe hym / & y
t
 was grete harme to all Brytayn / & the brytons bare hym to Stonehenge / and there buryed hym honourably.






¶ Of king Conan y
t
 was Curans cosin.


AFter this Curan regned Conan his cosyn / a proude knyght / & he regned w
t
out loue / & euer was medlyng w
t
 his people / & toke his vncle w
t
 warre sleynge his two children. The Saxons warred agaynst hȳ oftentymes / but he ouercame them / & so he was in peas all his lyftyme / & he regned .xiiij. yere / & af¦ter he dyed & lyeth at London.






¶ Of kyng Cortyf & Gurmond y
t
 came through the paynyms in to Brytayne.


AFter this Conan regned his co∣syn Cortyf / y
t
 was behated of all his people / & this Cortyf lost all britayn through warre / & in his tyme fel y
t
 grete myschefe in brytayn y
t
 thrystēdom was destroyed / & all y
e
 brytons were wyuen out of y
e
 londe / but afterward lefte 
 to the saxons / as afterward ye shal here For in that tyme there was a paynym that was called Gurmond y
e
 kȳges sone Daufrikes of y
e
 paynyms folke / & 
shold
 haue ben kynge after his fader / but he gaue it to his broder / & sayd he wold be no kynge tyll he had cōquered a realme in a straūge coūtree. And of hym prophe cyed Merlyn / callynge him a wolfe of y
e
 see. And he let assemble paynyms w
t
out nomrbe & shyppes. And goynge by y
e
 see he conquered dyuers londes / takyng he mage of many. And he came in Irionde & conquered it / that oftētymes warred vpon brytons / & brytons vpon them / & ofte wonne & oft lost / & gaue hostages to brytons. And so they sente to Gurmond there as he was in Irlonde / y
t
 he sholde come & helpe them agaynst y
t
 brytons / & they wold gladly make hym theyr lord. For he was a paynim / & they were pay∣nyms / and the brytons were chrysten. Whan Gurmond herde this / he hasted hym & arryued in scotlonde / & came in to Northumberlond where as the saxons were dwellyng / & they cōfermed y
t
 coue∣naūtes bytwene them made by othes & hostages / for to bere hym true fayth / & holde hym forlorde / & paye to hȳ truage by yere. Than began y
t
 saxons & the af∣fricans to destroye / robbe & brenne to w∣nes / & destroyed all maner thynge / spa∣ryng neyther man / woman / ne chylde / lerned nelewde / but slewe all / & kest dow¦ne townes / castels & chirches / & so put y
t
 londe to grete destruceyon. And as soone as they myght flee they fledde thens as well poore as ryche / bysshops & men of religyon / grete & small / some in to lytell Britayn / & some in to Cornewayle / and all those that myght haue shyppes.






¶ How kynge Gurmonde droue kynge Cortif to chuhestre / & slewe the britons and through subtylte gate the towne.








COrtyf the kyng fledde thens in to Chichestre that than was a good cite and a stronge / & there helde hym .xx. dayes. And this Gurmond came and be syeged it. But y
•
 cite was so stronge y
•
 he myght not gete it by no maner of wyse / wherfore they thought by subtylte to brenne the towne / they made engynes with glewe of nettes / and toke peces of tunder & fyre & boūde it to sparowes feet and afterwarde let them flee / and they anone ryght flewe in to the towne there as theyr nestes were / in thackes and in euyssynges of houses / & the fyre began to kyndle & brent all the towne. Whan y
•
 brytons sawe that / they hyed them out & fought / but anone they were slayne & discomfyted / & whyle the batayle duted the kynge all in despayre pryuely went in to wales / so y
•
 men wist not where he became. And so was the towne of Chi∣chestre takē & destroyed. And after Gur∣mond went & destroyed townes & citees that neuer after were made again / as it is seen yet in this lōde in many places.






¶How this londe was called Englōde for the name of Engist / and how many kynges were made after in this londe.


WHan Gurmond had destroyed all the londe through out / he gaue y
•
 londe to the saxons / & anone they toke it with good wyll. For y
•
 saxons longe ty∣me had desyred it / for as moche as they were of Engistes kynrede / that first had all y
•
 londe of Brytayn / & let them be cal∣led englyshmen / for bycause of Engistes name. And y
•
 londe they let call Englond in theyr language / & the folke ben called Englyshmen / for as moche as in his ty∣me it was called Engist londe whan he had cōquered it of Vortiger. But fro the tyme y
•
 Brute came fyrst in to this londe it was called Britayn / & y
•
 folke brytons But syth y
•
 tyme y
•
 Gurmond conquered this londe y
•
 saxons named it Englonde as before is sayd. And whan this was done / Gurmōd passed ouer in to fraūce & there cōquered many lōdes / & destroyed all chrysten people where as he came. And the saxons dwelled in this londe / & began fast to enhabyte it at theyr owne wyll / & they wold haue made newe kyn ges & lordes / but they coude neuer assent to haue onely one kyng for to be to them attendaūt / & therfore they made many kynges in dyuers shyres / as it was in Engistes tyme. The fyrst kyngdō was Kent / & that other Southsex / & y
•
 thyrde westsex / the fourth Estsex / and the fyfth Northumberlōde / the syxth Estangle / y
•
 is to saye Norfolk & Suffolk / & the .vij. Merchenrich / & that is ȳ erledom of Ni choll / Huntyngdon / Harford / Glo
estre / wynchestre / warwyk & Derby / & so de∣parted all Englōd in to .vij. partes. And after that it befell y
•
 tho kynges warred oftē tymes togyder. And euer he y
•
 was strongest toke hym y
•
 was feblest / & so it was longe tyme that they had no kyng


crowned amonge them / nor no chrysten man was than amonge them ne christē dom neyther. But were paynyms tyll y
•
 saynt Gregory was pope of Rome / that had seen children of y
•
 nacion of Englōde in y
•
 cite of Rome y
•
 were wonders fayre creatures / & had grete wyll & desyre to beholde them / & asked of y
•
 marchaūtes of whens they were & of what nacyon. And men tolde hym they were of Eng∣londe / & englysshe they were called / but they & all y
•
 people of englond were pay∣nyms / & byleued not on god. Alas sayd saynt Gregory / well may they be called englysshe / for they haue y
•
 visages of aū gels / and therfore well ought they to be christen. And for this cause saynt Grego ry sent saynt Austin in to englonde / & .xl. good men w
t
 hym that were of good lyfe & holy men to preche & teche / & to cōuerte the englysshe people / & turne thē to god / & y
•
 was in the .vj. yere y
•
 saynt Gregory had ben pope of Rome / y
•
 is to saye / after the incarnacyon of our lord Iesu Chryst v .C .lxxxv. yere as y
•
 cronycles telleth.






¶How saynt Austyn baptysed & cōuer∣ted kyng Adelbryght / and the bysshops that he made his felawes.


WHan saynt Austin came fyrst in to englonde / he arryued in the yle of Tenet / & so passed forth & came to Caun terbury / and there soiourned. And kyng Adelbryght of Kent y
•
 was of y
•
 lignage of Engist goodly receyued saynt Austyn & his felawes w
t
 moche honour / & foūde them all y
•
 them neded. And more ouer he gaue them a fayre place / y
•
 now is cal led the abbey of saynt Austin / in whiche place helyeth hymself shryned. ¶ This kynge Adelbryght was a good man / & with good wyll herd saynt Austyns pre dicacyons / and gaue hym leue to preche through out al his lōde of Kent to turne and cōuerte to hym all y
•
 people that he myght. It befell so afterward through goddes grace / y
•
 in a lytell tyme y
•
 kynge hymselfe was cōuerted to god / & all the people of his londe was baptysed. And in y
•
 meane whyle y
•
 people turned them to god / saynt Austyn came to Rochestre & there preched the worde of god / & the paynyms scorned hym therfore / & cast vpon hym reygh tayles / so that all his mantell was hanged full of those reygn tayles / & for more despite they cast on hȳ the guttes of reyghes and other fysshe. Wherfore y
•
 good mā saynt Austin was sore anoyed & greued / & prayed to god y
•
 all those children of y
•
 cite that sholde be borne afterward / y
•
 is to saye / in the cite of Rochestre myght haue tayles / and so they had. Whan the kyng herde of this vengeaūce y
•
 was fallen through saynt Austins prayer / he let make a hous in y
•
 honour of almyghty god / wherin wo∣men shold be delyuered of theyr children at the brydges ende / in the which bous yet women of the cite ben delyuered of chylde. Whan saynt Gregory had herde tell how the englysshe people were tur∣ned to god & cōuerted / he sent vnto saynt Austyn his pallyon by a bysshop y
•
 was called Paulyn / and made hym prymate and archebysshop of Englonde and sent worde that he sholde ordeyne and make bysshoppes in the londe. And anone as saynt Austyn had the pallyon of the di∣gnite of the archebysshop / he made two bysshoppes of his felawes the whiche came with hym from Rome / of whome that one was called Mellyte / & he helde his dignite at London / and that other was called Iustyne / and he helde his dignite at Rochestre. And this bysshop Mellyte than went to preche the worde of god in Essex / and there baptysed the kynge of y
•
 countree whiche was called Sicwith y
•
 was kyng Adelbryghtes to


syn his systers sone. This Iustyn went to preche in Southsex / & turned moche of the people to god / & saynt Austin him selfe preched through out all Englonde.






¶How saynt Austyn went in to wales where as the Brytons were / and how they wolde not be obedyent to the arche bysshop of Caunterbury.


WHan all Englōde was baptysed and turned to god / saynt Austin went in to y
•
 londe where as the brytons were to kepe them frō englyssh men / that is to saye in wales / & there he foūde monkes & abbeys / & .vij. bisshops For the brytons destroyed alway y
•
 chry sten people y
•
 saynt Austyn had cōuerted And he sayd to the bisshops that he was a legate of Rome / & prymate of all Eng∣londe / & that they sholde by all reason to hym be obedyent. And they sayd y
•
 they wolde not / but to y
•
 archebysshop of Car lyon they wolde / they wold neuer for no maner thinge be obedyent to y
•
 englyssh men. For they sayd / englysshmen be our aduersaryes / and haue dryuen vs out of our coūtree / & we ben chrysten men and euer haue ben / & the englysshmen haue euer bē paynyms / saue now of late that they be cōuerted. Saynt Austyn might of them haue none other answere / but sayd pertly that they wolde neuer meke them to hym ne to the pope of Rome. Wherfore saynt Austin returned agayn to king Adelbryght y
•
 was king of Kent & tolde him y
•
 his folke wold not be to no man obedyent / but to y
•
 archebysshop of Carlyon. Whan the king herde this / he was sore anoyed / & sayd that he wolde destroye them / & sent to Elfryde kyng of Northumberlonde y
•
 was his frende / y
•
 he shold come to hym w
t
 all y
•
 power that he myght / & he wold mete hym at Ley∣cestre / and fro thens they wolde go in to wales / & there destroye y
•
 archebysshop of Carlyon / and all those that had refu∣sed saynt Austyn.






¶How kyng Adelbryght & kyng Elfry de slewe Brecynall y
•
 was a kyng of bry tons that helde y
•
 coūtree of Leycestre.


IT befell so that there was a kyng of brytons that helde the coūtre of Leycestre / & all the countre aboute / his name was Brecynall. And this bryton herde tell y
•
 those two englysshe kynges wolde mete there at Leycestre for to go in to wales / he let ordeyne all the power that he had for to go fyght w
t
 these two kȳges / but lytel it auayled hym / for his folke were all slayne / & hymself fledde / & lost his londes for euermore. And these two kȳges Adelbryght & Elfryde dwel led a whyle at Leycestre / & departed the londe amonge them / and toke homage & feaute of the folke of y

 discōfyture that Brecmal had at Leycestre / & were won ders sore adrad of those two kynges / & toke & chose amōge them good men & ho ly / of heremytes / mōkes & preestes / & of other people grete plente / y
•
 wente bare fote and wolwarde for to haue mercy of those two kynges. But y
•
 kynges were so sterne & so wycked y
•
 they 
wold
 neuer speke w
t
 them / but slewe them all. Alas for sorowe / for they ne spared them no more than the wolfe doth the shepe / but smote of theyr hedes euerichone. And so they were all martyred y
•
 to them came that is to vnderstande .v .C. and .xl. And after they wente fro thens to Bangore for to slee all those y
•
 they myght fynde there of y
•
 brytons. And whan y

 was Bre∣cinals sone kyng of Leycestre / & he after regned nobly / & with grete honour.






¶How Cadewan kynge of Leycestre & Elfryde king of Northumberlond were frendes. And of the debate y

AFter that this bataile was done the britons assembled them and went thens & came to Leicestre / & made there Cadewan y

hold
 all y

 they assembled a grete host on bothe par tyes. And at y

 last it befell y
•
 Cadwalyn was discōfyted / & Edwyn pursued him and droue hym frō place to place / so y

 at the lasthe fled in to Irlōde. And Edwyn destroyed his londe / & cast downe castels & brent his maners / & departed all Cad walyns londe among his frendes. And lōge tyme after came Cadwalyn agayn from Irlonde with a stronge power / & in playne batayle slewe Edwyn and all his frendes / & namely them that with∣helde his londes by Edwyns gyfte.






¶How kynge Oswalde was slayne by kynge Cadwalyn & Peanda. And how Oswy that was saynt Oswaldes bro∣der regned after hym / & slewe Peanda.


WHan Edwyn was slayne Offris his sone vndertoke the warre a∣gaynst Cadwalin his vncle / so that this Offris dyed duryng y
•
 warre. And after the deth of Offris regned a gentyl chry∣sten man that moche lōued god almygh ty / that had all y
•
 londe of Northumber∣londe by herytage y
•
 was called O

•
 londe. But for as moche as he was frende to Edwin and helde a grete parte of y
•
 londe of Cadwa lyn. This Cadwalyn warred vpon him and droue hym towarde scotlonde. And whan Cadwalyn sawe that he wold not abyde / he wolde no longer pursue hym / but toke some of his folk to Peanda his broder in lawe / & prayed hym to pursue after Oswald tyll that he were taken or slayne. And Cadwalyn returned home agayn. Whan Oswald herd y
•
 
ydȳges that Cadwalin turned home agayn / he wolde no longer flee / but abode Peanda & gaue hym batayle / & Peanda was dis comfyted & fled & came agayn to Cadwa lyn / & sayd y
•
 wolde neuer holde a fote of


londe of hym / but yf so were y
•
 he wolde auenge hym on Oswald. Cadwalyn let assemble a grete hoost for to fyght with Oswald / so that he and Peanda came to Northumberlonde & gaue batayle vnto Oswald / & in y
•
 same batayle was Os∣wald slayne & his heed smyttenof / & af∣ter he was buryed in y
•
 abbey of Barde∣ney / in whiche place god hath wrought for hym many a fayre myracle / bothe there and els where. And anone Oswy his broder seased all the londe in to his handes y
•
 was this Oswaldes. And the folke of Northūberlond loued hym won ders well / & helde hym for theyr lorde: But he had men of his kynne worthy ynough y
•
 wolde haue departed y
•
 londe & they warred lōge togyder. And for as moche as they were not strōge ynough they came to Pcanda & prayed hym of helpe & socour / & pmysed hym of y
•
 londe largely vpon this couenaūt / y
•
 he wolde gouerne them & helpe & coūseyle. Peau∣da herde theyr prayer / & so spake w
t
 king Cadwalyn / that he shold ordeyn a grete hoost / & fast ordeyn hym in to Northum berlonde for to fyght with Oswy. And Oswy was a mekeman & moche loued peas & charite / & prayed Peanda of loue & peas / & profred hym of golde & syluer grete plente. And this Peanda was so proude y
•
 he wolde not graūte hym peas for no maner thynge / but for all thynge he wolde fyght with hym. So at y
•
 last there was set a day of batayle / & Oswy euer had trust vpon god / & Peanda tru∣sted to moche vpon his pryde and vpon his hoost that he had / and togyder they smote egerly. But Peanda was anone discomfyted & flayne. And this was af∣ter the incarnacion of our sauyour 
esu Chryst. vj .C. and .lv. yere. And this Os∣wy regned .xxviij. yere / & a kynge that was called Oswyne that was Pean∣daes cosyn warred vpon hym / and to∣gyder they fought / but Oswy had the victory of Oswyne / & was discomfyted and slayne / and lyeth at Cynmouth.






¶ How kynge Cadwaldre y
•
 was Cad∣walins sone regned after his fader / and was the last kynge of Brytons.


AFter y
•
 deth of Cadwalin regned his sone Cadwaldre well & no∣bly / & his moder was y
•
 sister of Peanda And whā he had regned .xij. yere he fell in to a grete sekenes / & than was there a grete discorde bytwene the lordes of y
•
 londe / that eche warred vpō other. And yet in that tyme there fell so grete derth and scarcete of corne & other vytayles in this londe y
•
 a man myght go .iij. or .iiij. dayes fro towne to towne that he sholde not fynde to bye for golde ne syluer breed wyne / ne none other vytayle / wherw
t
 a man myght lyue. But onely the people lyued by rotes of herbes / for other ly∣uynge had they none / so moche was it fayled all about / fysshes / wylde beestes & all other thynge / so y
•
 yet to this mys∣auenture there fell so grete mortalyte & pestilence amonge the people by the cor∣rupcyon of y
•
 deed bodyes. For they dyed so sodeinly / both grete & small lorde & seruaūt in etynge / goynge & spe kyng / they fell downe & dyed / so y
•
 neuer was herde of more sodeyn deth amonge the people. For he y
•
 went for to bury the deed body / with y
•
 same deed body was buryed. And so they y
•
 myght flee fledde & forsoke theyr londes & houses / as well for the grete hunger / derth / & scarcete of corne & other vytayle / as for y
•
 grete mor talite & pestylence in the londe / & went in to other londes for to saue theyrlyues / & lefte y
•
 londe all deserte & wasted / so that there was no man for to trauayle & tyll the loude / so that y
•
 loude was 
a

of corne & all other fruytes for define of tillers / & this misauēture duted .xj. yere & more / y
•
 no man myght ere ne sowe.






¶ How Cadwaldre went out of this londe in to lytell Brytayne.


CAdwaldre sawe grete hunger / mortalite & pestilence / & the londe all poore / & faylynge cornes & other vy∣tayles / & his folke perisshed / & sawe also the moost party of his lond all wasted & voyde of people / he apparayled hȳ & his folke y
•
 were lefte alyue / & passed ouer in to lytel Brytayn with a lytel nauy vnto kyng Aleyn y
•
 he moche loued that was his cosyn / & that his fader had moche loued in his tyme. And as they sayled in the see he made moche lamētacyon / & so dyd all those that were with hym / and sayd. Dedisti nos dite tan{quam} oues estarū et in gentibus dispersisti nos.


¶ And than began Cadwaldre to com∣playne hym to his tolke pyteously / and sayd. Alas sayd he / to vs wretches and caytyues is sorowe for our grete synnes of the whiche we wolde not amende vs whyle we had space / & now repentaūce is comen vpon vs through mysauēture whiche chaceth vs out of our owne re∣alme & propre soyle / out of the whiche somtyme Romayns / Scottes / Saxons nor Danes myght not exple vs. But what auayleth it now to vs that before tyme dyuers tymes haue goten many other londes / syth it is not y
•
 wyll of god that we abyde & dwell in our owne lode God that is very iudge that all thinges knoweth before they be done or made / he seeth that we wolde not cese of our syn∣nes / & that our enemyes myght not vs nor our lygnage exyle fro and out of our realme / he wolde that we amended vs of our folyes / and that we sholde se our propre defautes / & therfore hath shewed to vs wrathe / & wyll chastyse vs of our misdedes / syth that he doth vs without batayle or strengthe of our enemyes by grete cōpanyes wretchedly to leue our realme & propre londe. Turne agayn ye Romayns / turne agayne ye Scottes / turne agayne ye Saxons / turne agayn ye frensshmen / now sheweth to you Bri¦tayn all deserte / the whiche your power myght neuer make deserte / ne yet your power hath not put vs now in exde / but onely the power of the kyng almyghty whome we haue oft offended by our fo∣lyes / the whiche we wolde not leue vn∣tyll he chastised vs by his diuyne power Amonge the wordes & lament acyons y
•
 kyng Calwaldre made to his folke they arryued in lytel Gritayn & came to king Aleyn. And y
•
 kyng receyued hym with grete ioye / & made him to be serued won ders nobly / and there he dwelled longe tyme after. The englysshe people that were lefte alyue & were escaped y
•
 grete hunger & mortalite lyued in y
•
 best wyfe that they might: & moche people sprang and came of them. And they sente in to saxonie where they were borne to theyr frendes for men / women / and chyldren to restore the citees with people and the townes that were all boyde of people / & for to labour / trauayle and tyll the e
th. Whan the Saxons had herde these ty∣dynges / they came in to this londe won ders thycke in grete cōpanyes / & lodged themselfe in the coūtree all about where that they wolde / for they foūde no man to with stande them ne lette. And so they wexed & multyplyed gretly / & vsed the customes of y
•
 coūtre wherof they were comen / and the lawes & the language of theyr owne londe. And they chaunged y
•
 names of citees / townes / castelles / and boutghes / and gaue them names / and called them as they now be called. And they helde the coūtets / the batonages / 


and the lordshyppes & countrees in ma∣ner as y
•
 Brytons before ryme had com∣passed them. And amonge other grete companyes that came from Germayn in to this londe came y
•
 noble quene that was called Sexburga with men & wo∣men without nombre / & arryued in the coūtree of Northumberlonde / & toke the lond from Albion vnto Cornewayle / for her & for her folke. For there was none that myght them let / for all was deso∣late & voyde of people / but it were a fewe poore Brytons that were lefte on moū∣taynes & wodes vutyll that tyme. And fro that tyme forth lost the Britons this realme for all theyr dayes / and the Eng¦lysshe people began to regne / & departed the londe bytwene them / and they made many kynges aboute by dyuers partes of the londe as here ben deuysed. The fyrst of Westsex / the seconde Merchen∣rych / the thyrde Estangle / the fourthe kent / & the fyfthe Southsex. All those regned in this londe after that Cadwal∣dre was passed out of this londe & dwel∣led in lytell Brytayn with kynge Aleyn his cosyn and true frende. And whan he had longe dwelled there / and had know∣lege that the mortalite & pestylence was ouerpassed / & that the londe was reple∣nysshed with alyen people / he thought to come agayn in to this londe / & prayed kynge Aleyn his cosyn of socour & helpe that he myght be restored agayn to his owne propre realme & fyrst dignite. And kynge Aleyn graūted hym his askyng. Than dyd he apparayle hym to take his waye & vyage in to this londe. And prayed god almyghty deuoutly that he wolde make to hym demonstracyon / yf his prayer in to this londe were to hym pleasaūt or not. For agaynst the wyll of god almyghty he wolde no thynge do. Whan he had thus deuoutly made his prayer / a voyce from heuen sayd to hym and badde hym leue that iourney away in to Englonde / and that he sholde go to the pope of Rome / for it was not y
•
 wyll of almyghty god that y
•
 Brycons sholde regne ony more in Brytayne / nor neuer recouer the lond vnto the tyme that the pphecy that Merlyn sayd before be ful∣fylled. And that shold neuer be vnto the tyme were comen that y
•
 relykes of his body shall be brought fro Rome & trans∣lated in to Brytayne. And whan the re∣likes of other sayntes y
•
 haue ben hydde for the persecucyon of the paynym folke shall be foūde and openly shewed / than shall they recouer theyr lōde agayn / the whiche they haue soo longe tyme loste through theyr deseruynge. Whan Cad∣waldre had herde this answere / he mer uayled gretly / & tolde it to kyng Aleyn. Thankynge Aleyn sent for the clergye of his londe / and made them to brynge the storyes & prophecyes that Merliu & Sybyll had sayd in theyr prophecyes. And whan he knewe that the prophecy that Festom had prophecied of the Egle and other prophecyes accorded to the di∣uyne answere y
•
 Cadwaldre had herde∣he coūseyled hym & ryght faythfully de∣syred hym to leue his people & his nauy and submytte hym to the disposicyon of god / & do all that the aūgell had cōmaū∣ded hym. Than Cadwaldre called ynor his sone and yuory his cosyn that was his systers sone / & sayd to them. Take sayd he my folke & my nauy that is here all redy / and passe in to wales / and be ye lordes of Brytons y
•
 no dyshonour come to them by interrupeyon of y
•
 paynyms folke for defaute of lordes. And than he hymselfe lefte his realme of Brytayne & his folke for euermore / & toke his waye vnto the pope of Rome Sergius / the whiche worshypped hym moche / and so he was confessed / & toke penaunce for his synnes. And he had not longe dwel∣led


there that he ne dyed the .xij. kalend of Maye / the yere of grace. b .C .lxxix.






¶ How kynge Osfa was souerayne aboue all the kynges of Englonde / & how euery kyng warred vpon other.


IT befell so that all the kynges in that tyme that were in the londe / as they of Westsex / Merchenrych / Est∣angle / of Kent / and of Southsex / and of other costes eche warred vpon other / & he y
•
 was moost myghty toke the londe of hym y
•
 was moost feblest. But there was a kynge amonge them that was called Offa / that was saynt Oswaldes broder. This Offa conquered all y
•
 kyn∣ges of the lond / and regned aboue them all. And so grete was the warre in eue∣ry coūtre bytwene kynges that no man myght wyte how the londe went. But abbottes / pryours / and men of religyon wrote the lyues & dedes of kinges / how longe euery of them regned / & in what countree / & in what maner euery kyng dyed / and of bysshops also. And therof made grete bokes / and let call them cro nycles. And the good kynge Alured had that boke in his warde. And let brynge it vnto Wynchestre / and let it be fast ta∣ched to a pyller that men sholde it not re¦meue ne bere thens / so that euery man myght se it & thervpon loke. For therin ben conteyned the lyues of all y
•
 kynges that euer were in Englonde.






¶ How the kyng of Northumberlonde Osbryght forlaye the wyfe of Buerne Bocard through strength / & afterward this Buerne conquered the kynge with power and strengthe.


ANd thus it befell in y
•
 same tyme that there was a kȳg in Northū berlonde that was called Osbryght / & soiourned at Yorke / & this kynge wente vpon a daye in to a wode for to dysporte hȳ. And whan he came agayn / he went pryuely in to a good mannes hous that was called Bucrne / & the good man of that place was gone that tyme to y
•
 see. For oftentymes he went there to espye theues & robbers that oftētymes were wont to come in to the londe to robbe / brenne / & slee. The lady that was Buer nes wyfe was a wonders fayre womā And the kyng came vnto her whan her husbonde was absent. Ad so she trusted none harme vnto the kynge / and welco∣med hym with moche honour / & wor∣thely serued hym of all thynges. Whan the kynge had eten / he coke the lady by the hande and ladde her in to a chambre and sayd that he wolde speke with her in coūseyle. And made all y
•
 folke vor de out of the chambre / saue onely the lady and he. But the lady wyst not wherfore he dyd it / tyll y
•
 he had done all his wyll. And whan he had done this dede / he re∣turned agayne to Yorke / & lefte the lady there sore wepyng for the dede that the kynge had done to her. And whan hee lord was comen home & sawe her wepe & make suche sorowe & mournynge / he asked of her what she had done / & why she made suche sorowe. Syr she sayd / subtylly and falsly the kynge Osbryght hath done me shame & vylany agaynst my wyll / & tolde hym the trouth how y
•
 kynge had forlayne her with strength / wherfore she sayd she had leuer be deed than lyue. Fayre loue be styll sayd he / for agaynst strengthe feblenes is lytell worth / & therfore of me shalt thou neuer the lesse be loued / and namely for thou hast tolde me y
•
 trouth. And yfalmygh∣ty god graūte me my lyfe / I shall well auenge the. This Buerne was a grete man & a myghty lorde / & was well belo ued / & had grete frendes / & let sende for


the gretest lordes of the londe / & to them made his complaynt of y
e
 despyte that y
e
 kynge had done to hȳ / & sayd y
•
 he wolde be auenged how so euer it were. And all his frendes coūseyled hym y
t
 he shold go to yorke where as the kyng was to de∣fye hym. And Buerne 
eke his meyny & came to the kyng. And whan the kyng sawe hym / he called hȳ curteysly by his name. And Buerne answered hym / & to hym sayd. Syr I you defye / & yelde vp feautees / homages & londes / & as mo∣the as I haue holden of you / and from this tyme forwarde I wyll neuer of the no thynge holde. And so he departed fro the kynge without more speche or ony abydynge / and toke leue of his frendes and went in to Denmarke / & complay∣ned to the kynge Godryne / & tolde hym of the despyte that kyng Osbryght had done to hym of his wyfe / & prayed hym of socour and helpe for to auenge hym. Whan kynge Godryne of Denmarke & the Danes had herde the complaynt of this Buerne / and of the prayer that he bad / they were wonders glad in theyr hertes / for as moche as they might fyn∣de a cause for to go in to Englonde for to warre vpon Englysshmen / and also for to auenge Buerne of the despyte that y
t
 kynge Osbryght had done to his wyfe. And for as moche as Buerne was sibbe vnto the kynge of Denmarke / they let ordeyne anone a grete hoost of men / and let ordeyne shyppes for them / & as mo∣che as them neded to haue to that viage And whan all the hoost was redy / the kyng made his two bretherne chefe ca∣pytaynes / that were noble knyghtes of body and also bolde / that one was cal∣led Hungar / and that other Hubba.






¶ How the Danes toke yorke / and slewe kyng Osbryght / and soone af∣ter slewe kynge Elle.


ANd whan all thynge was redy the two brethern toke leue of the kynge Godryne / & went to warde the see for to passe ouer into Englōde as fast as they myght spede. Now is Buerne so well cōforted / & so fast hyed hym with y
•
 Danes / that they be arryued in y
•
 north coūtree / & came through out Holdernes and destroyed all the coutre
 / and brent townes / & robbed folke / & slewe all that myght be taken tyll that they came vn∣to yorke. And whan kynge Osbryght sawe them come / he toke all his people that he had with hym & came out of the cyte & faught w
t
 them / but no foyson he ne had agaynst them / & moche of y
•
 peo∣ple there were slayne on bothe partyes / & kynge Osbryght hymselfe there was slayne / & the cite anone was taken & the Danes went in. ¶ And there was also an other king in Northumberlond that Buernes frendes had chosen / and helde hym for kyng / a man y
•
 was called Elle for as moche as they wolde not to kyng Osbryght be attendaūt / for the despyte that he had done to Buerne theyr cosyn. It bef
 thus y
•
 kyng Elle was gone to the wode for to dysporte 
ym / & of veny∣sou some he had taken. And as he sate in the wode at meet he sayd to a knyght. We haue well sped & moche venyson ta∣ken. And with y
•
 worde came in a man & sayd to hym. yf ye so moche of venyson haue wonne / an hondred tymes more ye haue lost / for all this coūtree the Danes haue goten / & taken y
•
 cite of yorke / & a∣gaynst you shall it hold / y
•
 neuer ye shall come therin / and for so moche they haue slayne kyng Os
right. Whan king Elle herde these wordes / he let assemble all y
•
 folke of the countree / & ordeyned all the power that he myght haue / and wolde haue goten the cite of yorke w
t
 strength. But the Danes came out anone & gane hym a stronge batayle / and slewe kyng


Elle and the moost parte of the people that he had brought with him. And the same place there they were slayne shall euermore be called Elle crofte / and that place is a lytell from yorke. And than y
•
 Danes neuer rested tyll they had con∣quered all Northumbetlonde / & in that countree they made wardryns / & went ferther in to y
•
 lande & toke Notyngham & there they abode all y
•
 wyuter / doynge all the sorowe that they myght. And af∣ter whan somet tyme came / they reine∣ued from Notyngham / and came to Ni¦choll and Lyndefey / & to Holand. For no man myght them withstand / so moche power and sttength they had.






¶ How saynt Edmund the kynge was martyred.


ANd so ferre had the Danes pas∣sed from coūtree to coūtree / and euermore brennynge & robbynge / & de∣stroyed all y
•
 they myght tyll they came to Tetford / & in that coūtree they foūde a chrysten kyng that moche loued god & his werkes / that was called Edmund / & he was kyng of Northfolke & South folke. This kyng saynt Edmund ordey∣ned as moche folke as he myght / and fought w
t
 the Danes / but he & his folke were discomfyted / & the kyng hymselfe was dryuen vnto the castell of Frame∣lyngham / & the Danes pursued hym & tame vnto the same castell. And whan kyng Edmund sawe y
•
 the castel myght not withstande them / he came agaynst them / with whome y
•
 Danes fyrst spa∣ke / and anone they asked of hym where king Edmund was. Now forsothe said he / whan I was in y
•
 castell there was the kyng / and whan I went out of the castell / he went out also / & whether he shall escape or dye / at goddes wyll must it be. Whan saynt Edmund had named god / by that they wyst well that it was hymselfe. And anone Hubba & Hungat toke hym and sayd that he shold forsake god and all chrysten lawes / as many other had done before hym. And saynt Edmund sayd that he wolde not / but ta ther he wold suffre deth for goddes loue & his lawes also. Than toke they kyng Edmund & boūde hym to a tree / & made theyr archers shote at hym w
t
 arowes tyll y
•
 his body stycked as full of arowes as an vrchen full of pryckes. But for all the payne that they dyd hym / he wolde neuer forsake god. And in the same tur∣ment and payne he dyed / and betoke his soule to almyghty god. And whan they sawe that he was deed / they smote of his heed. And in this maner as ye haue herde was saynt Edmund martyred.






¶ How▪ Hubba and Hungar toke the towane of Redynge.


WHan saynt Edmund was marry red / Hungar & Hubba departed thens with all theyr Danes to Redyng And as they wente thyder warde they destroyed & brent to w
es and cyters & slewe all chrysten people that wolde not forsake god / and kest downe chirches & came to Redynge and toke the cownr & there helde them tyll that kyng Ed
lf of Westsex came thider with at his power for to take y
•
 to wne. Than came out the Danes to gyue batayle to kyng Edrif / and at that batayle was slayne an 
le of the Danes that was called Eidrak. Vpon the morowe came kynge Eldred and his broder Alured with a stronge power and a grete hoost. And the Kyng Edelf came agayne (that had fo
 the daye before) to that batayle. And the Danes than came out for to fyght with them / & y
•
 batayle was wonders st
ge For many a man was there slayne / and


the Danes that daye had the victory / & the kynge Eldred & his broder Alured y
•
 daye were discomfyted. But the fourth daye after y
•
 Danes & the Englyshmen fought togyder an other tyme vpō Ekel dene / & there was slayne a kyng of Deu marke that was called Ra
ing / & foure erles of grete power. And that daye the Danes had shame / for they were driuen to Engilfelde. And the .xv. day after the Danes & the Englyshmen fought togy∣der at Rafyng / & there were y
•
 Englysh men dyscōfyted. And frō thens a Dane that was called Roynt went to Redyng with his hoost / & destroyed all that he myght take. And kynge Eldred fought with hym / but he was so woūded that he dyed. And he regned but .v. yere / and lyeth at Womburne.

¶ Nota Machomitum.


MAchomyte the duke of sarasyns and turkes was this tyme. And he was the deceyuer of all the worlde / a false prophete / the messenger of the de∣uyll / the foregoer of Antechryst / the ful∣fyller of heresy / and of all false men the meruaylest / of whome the dominacyon thus began. ¶ There was a certayne famous clerke at Rome and coude not spede in his maters that he desyred to haue spedde in / than he receded frō Ro∣me ouer the see / and procured many a man to go with hym / amonge whome was this fals Machomyte a grete man of wytte. And this clerke {pro}mysed hym to make hym duke of his coūtree / yf he wolde be guyded after hym. There he nourysshed a doue / & put all y
•
 corne that the doue ete in to Machomytes ere / & so this doue had neuer no meet but in his ere. The foresayd clerke on a daye called the people & meued them to chose suche a prynce as the holy ghost wolde shewe to them in fourme of a doue. And anone this clerke secretly let this doue flee / the whiche after his olde custome came to Machomyte / & put his byll in his eere. And whan the people sawe this / anone he was chosen duke of that people. And whan he was made duke of this people of Corosame / he sayd y
•
 he was the very prophete of god. Thā he made a boke of his lawe y
•
 was called Alcaron. But he dyd it by the informacyon of thre of his maysters / to whom y
•
 deuyll mynistred the auctorite & the connynge. The fyrst mayster was a iewe a grete astronomer & a nygromancer / the second was Iohn de Antiochia / the thyrde was Sergius an heretyke. And these thre made an vn gracyous lawe & an vnhappy / & what someuer was 
hard
 of byleue & tedyous to do / they lefte y
•
 out of the lawe / & they put that thinge in theyr lawe y
•
 worldly men were prone & redy to do / that is to saye / glotony / lechery / rapyne / & suche other. And also this Machomyte ordey∣ned y
•
 a man shold haue as many wiues as he myght occupy & fynde / and refuse them twyse or thryse or .iiij. tymes / & ta¦ke them again. And many meruaylous & fals thinges he made in his lawe / the whiche were to lōge to reherse here / but they be playne in his boke of Alcaron / & euer he wrote i his boke y
•
 our lord spake to Machomyte his {pro}phete / sayenge on this wyse or on this. Thus by his fals meanes he deceyued y
•
 people. And whā his maysters & he had made this y
•
 was so delectable / he wrote it in a boke with lettres of gold / & nourysshed a camell se∣cretly in a pryuy place / & all onely w
t
 the hādes of Machomyte was alway fedde


And there pryuely he tyed this boke of the lawe y
•
 he had made about y
•
 camels necke / & put this camell forth on a tyme in to a felde a fore daye / and this camell ioyed in his lyberte / for he was neuer lose afore. And he wold suffre no man to come & touche hym. And so there was a grete fame of suche a camell / and all the people ranne to se hym / amonge whom was this Machomyte. But whan the camell sawe hym that alway had fedde hym / anone he ranne vnto hym. And he had taught this camel afore tyme to fal downe on his knees & lycke his handes And so he dyd afore all the people. The people thā cryed & sayd / that there was a very ensample that he was the true prophete of god. Than they prayed Ma¦chomyte to open y
•
 holy boke w
t
 his holy handes / the whiche was sent frō heuen euermore to be kepte. In y
•
 whiche boke is shewed how the people shall worshyp god. And Machomyte sayd. This boke was wryten with aūgels handes. So by these false meanes he turned to his lawe all the londe of Perse / & all the eest imperyall agaynst Heraclius the empe∣rour. And he occupyed vnto the ende of Alexandre and Egypte / Libia / Arabia / & Siria. Than after he enfected all Af∣frica / & but that the grace of god w
t
 stode hym he had enfected all spayne & fraūce And many other thynges he dyd / that were to moche to wryte in this boke.


COnstantyne the thyrde / the sone of Heracli
 was emperour .xxvij. yere. This Constantyne was a cursed man / a grete tyraunt / and an heretyke false / subtyll & obyous to chrysten men / nor he gaue no place to pope Martyn / & he reysed a grete host agaynst the Lom∣barbes / & there he lost the felde & fledde to Rome. And honourably was recey∣ued of the pope Vitellian{us} / and other of the cite. And he rewarded them not lyke after theyr merytes as a prynce sholde haue done / but vsed forth tyranny & he∣resye / wherfore at y
•
 last he was slayne of his owne knyghtes in a bath / y
•
 whi∣che wolde no longer suffre his tyranny. And so he wretchedly lyued / & dyed vn∣happely. ¶ Martin{us} the first was pope after Theodorū .vj. yere. This Marti∣nus was a very holy man / and strong∣ly stroue for the fayth of god. And whan he sayd masse on a certayne daye at the awter / there pursued hym to slee hym a man whiche was called Spa
arius of Olymphe / and whan he wolde haue 
nytten hym he was blynde sodeynly. This same man called a Sinody in the cite of Rome / and he dampned Syrum / Alexandrū / Sergiū / Pyrum / & Paulū heretykes. Wherfore Constantyne the emperour exiled hym / & he dyed a saynt ¶ Eugenius a Romayn was pope af∣ter Martyn almoost thre yere / and was an holy mā / but of hym lytell actes ben wryten. ¶ Vitellianus was pope after hym .xiiij. yere. This mā made y
•
 songe that the Romayns vseth / and accorded it also with y

 organes. And he also had the grace of the emperour / the whiche was wroth with his predecessours / ne∣uerthelesse afterward he stode not in his cōcorde. Ne hytherto I coude not fynde that euer the chirche of Rome had fully after the deth of Cōstantyne y

¶ Anno domini. M .iiij. Nota.


SIluester the second was pope af¦ter Gregory .iiij. yere / & he was made pope by the helpe of the deuyll / to whome he dyd homage / for he sholde gyue hym all thynge that he desyred / & he was called Gylbert. And his enemy gate hym the grace of y
e
 kynge of fraūce and he made hym bysshop of Remensis but anone he was deposed. And after he gate the grace of the Emperour / & was made bysshop of Rauennie / & after pope but he had an ende anone / & so haue all that put theyr hope in fals deuyls. Yet men trust in his saluacyon for certayne demonstracions of his sepulture / & for y
e
 grete penaūce y
t
 he dyd in his last ende. For he made his handes & legges to be cut of / & dismēbred all his body / & made them to be cast out at the dore to foules / & than his body to be drawen w
t
 wylde beestes / and there to be buryed where so euer they rested as an hoūde. And they stode styll at saynt Iohn de Latrans / & there he was buryed / & that was signe of his saluacyon. ¶ Iohānes the .xviij. was pope .v. monethes. ¶ Iohannes the .xix. was pope after hym fyue yere.

And it is redde that many of these dukes of Barry were holy men / not all onely in absteynynge them from flesshly desyres / but also in vertuous ly∣uyng. And this Henry had a syster that was as holy as he / whome he gaue to wyfe vnto the kynge of Hungary. And she brought all Hungary vnto the right byleue and chrysten fayth. And his wy∣ues name was San

At the last with a blyssed ende he decessed. And in the lyf of saynt Laurence he and his wyfe be put for ensamples bycause of theyr holy and vertuous lyuynge. ¶ Benedict{us} was pope after Iohn .xi. yere. This man had grete stryfe in his dayes.

And this fygure sayd he trusted no thynge in the mercy of god / & no thynge profyted hym that was done for hym / for it was goten by extorcyon & vniustly.

¶ Of kyng Knoght that was a Dane.


ANd after the deth of this Eldred Knoght that was a Daue begā to regne. But Edmund Irensyde y
t
 was king Eldredes sone by his fyrst wyfe or∣deyned a grete power of men / & began to warre on kynge Knoght. And so he dyd many tymes & ofte / & the warre was so strōge & harde y
e
 wonder it was to wyte And the quene Emme y
t
 than dwelled at westmynster had grete drede of her two sones Alured & Edward / lest they sholde be destroyed through y
e
 warre / wherfore she sente them ouer see in to Normandy to the duke Richard theyr vncle / & there they dwelled in safete & peas lōge tyme. ¶ This Edmund Irensyde & Knoght the Dane warred fyersly togyder. But at y
e
 last they were accorded in this ma∣ner / that they sholde departe the realme bytwene them / and so they dyd / and lo∣ued togyder lyke two bretherne.






¶ How kyng Edmund Irensyde was slayne through treason by a traytour y
t
 was called Edryth of Stratton.


ANd than after regned kyng Ed∣mūd Irensyde & Knoght y
e
 dane But thus it befel afterward y
t
 in y
e
 same yere that they were accorded & so moche loued togyder / wherfore a fals traytour had enuy at the loue that was bytwene them / whose name was Edrith of stra
¦to
 / that was a grete lorde y
t
 was Ed∣munde Irensydes man / & of hym helde all the londe that he had / & neuerthelesse he thought to betraye his lorde / & make Knoght kyng of all the londe / to the en∣tent rychely to be auaūced / & with hym to be well beloued. Wherfore he prayed his lorde Edmunde Irensyde on a daye with hym for to ete. And the kyng hym curteysly graūted / and to hym came at his prayer. And at meet the kyng was ryally serued with dyuerse metes and drynkes. And whan nyght came that he sholde go to bedde / the kyng toke his owne meyny and went to the chambre where as he shold take his nyghtes rest And as he loked aboute hym he sawe a fayre ymage & a well made in semblaūt as it were an archer with a bowe bent in his hande / & in y
e
 bowe a fyne arowe. Kynge Edmund went nere to beholde it better. And whan he was by it / anone y
e
 arowe smote hym through the body / & there slewe the kynge / for y
e
 engyn was made to slee his owne lorde traytoursly. And whan kynge Edmund was thus deed & slayne / he had regned but .x. yere And his people made moche sorowe for him / & his body they bare to Glastenbu¦ry / & there buryed hym. And this fals traytour Edrith anone went to y
e
 quene that was kynge Edmundes wyfe that wyst not of her lordes deth / & toke from her two sones that were fayre & yonge that her lorde had goten on her / that one was called Edwarde / & that other Ed∣wyne / & ladde them w
t
 hym to London / & toke them to kyng Knoght y
t
 he sholde do with them what his wyl were. And told hȳ how subtylly he had slayne king Edmund bycause y
e
 Knoght sholde haue all the londe of Englonde. ¶ O thou fals traytoure / hast y
u
 slayne my true broder


that was so true bycause of me / a man that I moost loued in the worlde. Now by my heed I shall for thy trauayle the well rewarde as thou hast deserued / & anone let hym be taken / and boūde hym handes & feet in maner of a traytour / & let cast hym in to the ryuer of Tamyse. And in this maner the fals traytour en∣ded his lyfe. The kyng toke y
e
 two chyl∣dren & put them vnto the abbot of West mynster to warde & to kepe tyll he wyst what was best with them for to do.






¶ How kynge Knoght sent bothe kyng Edmondes sones in to Denmarke for to be slayne / and how they were saued.


ANd it befel soone afterward that kynge Knoght had all the londe in his handes: & spoused y
e
 quene Emme through consent of al his barons / for she was a fayre woman / the whiche was Eldredes wyfe / and the dukes syster of Normandy / & they lyued togyder with moche loue as reason wolde. The kyng asked vpon a daye coūseyle of the quene what was best to do w
t
 Edmond Iren∣sydes sones. Syr sayd she / they be the ryght heyres of the londe / and yf they lyue they wyll do you moche sorowe w
t
 warre / and therfore let sende them in to a straūge londe aferre / to some man that may destroye them. The king anone let call a Dane that was called Walgar / & cōmaūded hym that he sholde lede those two chyldren in to Denmarke / & so to do and ordeyne for them that he sholde ne∣uer more here of them. Syr sayd this Walgar / your commaūdement gladly shall be done. And anone he toke the two chyldren & ledde them in to Denmarke. And for as moche as he sawe that the chyldren were wonders fayre & m
ke / he had of them grete pite & ruth / & wold not slee them / but ledde them to y
e
 kynge of Hungary for to nourysshe. For this Walgar was well beknowen with the kynge & well beloued. Anone the kynge asked fro whens the children were. And Walgar tolde hym & sayd y
t
 they were y
e
 ryght heyres of Englonde / and therfore men wolde destroye them / & therfore syr vnto you they be comen to seke mercy & helpe / & for soth yf they may lyue your men they shall become / and of you they shall holde all theyr londe. The kynge of Hungary receyued thē with moche ho∣nour / and let them worthely be kepte. And thus it befell afterwarde that Ed∣wyne y
e
 yonger broder dyed / & Edwarde the elder broder lyued / a fayre man and a stronge / and a large of body / & gentyll and curteys of condicyons / so y
t
 all men loued hym. And this Edwarde in y
e
 cro∣nycles is called amonge Englysshmen Edwarde the outlawe. And whan he was made knyght / the kynges dough∣ter of Hungary loued him moche for his goodnes and his fayrnes / so that she cal¦led hym her derlynge. The kynge that was her fader perceyued well the loue that was bytwene them two / & he had none heyr but onely that doughter. And the kynge vouchedsafe his doughter to no man so well as he dyd to hym that she loued so well / and he her agayn and gaue her vnto hym with a good wyll. And Edwarde her spoused with moche honour. The kyng of Hungary sent af∣ter all his barons and made a solemp
e feest and a ryche weddynge / and made all men to vnderstande y
t
 this Edwarde sholde be kyng after his decesse of all the londe of Hungary. Of the whiche ty∣dynges they were all ryght glad. And this Edwarde begate vpon this lady a sone the whiche was called Edgar He∣lyng / and afterwarde a doughter that was called Margarete / that afterwar∣de was quene of Scotlonde. And by the


kyng of scotlond that was called Man∣colin she had a doughter that was called Maud that was quene afterwarde of Englonde through kyng Henry y
•
 was the fyrst sone of the conquerour that her wedded / & he begate on her a doughter that was called Maud / that afterward was empresse of Almayne. And of this Maud came the kyng of Englonde that vnto this daye is called Henry the em∣presse sone / and yet had this Edwarde an other doughter by his wyfe y
t
 was called Christian / & she was a nonne.






¶ How kynge Knoght y
t
 was a proude man conquered Nor way / and how he became afterwarde meke and mylde.


NOw haue ye herde of Edmunde Irensydes sones y
t
 king Knoght wende they had ben slayne as he had cō maūded Walgar before. And this kyng Knoght had in his handes all y
•
 realme of Englond & Denmark. And after that they went vnto Norway for to cōquere that londe. But the kynge of the londe y
t
 was called Elaf came with his people / & wende to haue well kepte & defended his londe / & so there he faught w
t
 hym / tyll at y
•
 last he was slayne in y
t
 batayle. And thā this Knoght toke all y
•
 londe in to his hādes. And whā he had cōquered Norway / & takē feaute & homage there he came agayne in to Englonde / & helde hȳselfe so grete a lorde / y
t
 hym thought in all the worlde was not his pere / & be∣came so proude & hauteyne that it was grete wonder. ¶ And so it befell vpon a daye as he had herd masse at west myn∣ster / & wolde haue gone in to his palays the wawes of the Tamyse so swyftely came agaynst hym y
•
 almoost they tou∣ched his feet. Than sayd y
•
 kyng with a proude herte. I cōmaunde the water to turne agayn / or elles I shall make the. The wawes for his cōmaūdemēt wold not spare / but flowed in heyght more & more. The kyng was so proude of herte that he wold not flee y
•
 water but abode styll in y
•
 water / & bette it w
t
 a yerde y
•
 he had in his hande / & cōmaūded y
e
 water y
t
 it sholde go no ferder. But for all his cō∣maūdement y
•
 water 
wold
 not cese / but encreased more & more / so that the kyng was all wete / & stode depe in the water And whan he sawe the water wold not do his cōmaūdement / he w
t
drewe hym & stode vpon a stone / holdyng vp his han∣des on hye / & sayd herynge all y
•
 people. This god y
t
 maketh y
•
 see thus aryse on hye is kyng of all kynges / & of all mygh tes moost / and I am a caytyf & a deedly man / & he may neuer dye / & all thynge doth his cōmaūdement & hym obeyeth. To y
t
 god I praye y
t
 he be my warraūt / for I knowlege me a caytyf feble & of no power / & therfore I wyll go vnto Rome without ony longe lettyng / my wycked nes to punysshe / & me to amende. For of god I clay me my londe for to holde / & of none other. And anone made redy his heyre / & hȳselfe went to Rome without ony lettynge. And by y
•
 waye dyd many almes dedes / & at Rome also. And whā he had ben there & done penaūce for his synnes / he came agayn in to Englonde / & became a good man & an holy / leuyng all maner pryde / & lyued an holy lyfe / & made two abbeys of saynt Benet / one in Englonde / and another in Norway / by cause he loued saynt Benet more specyal¦ly than ony other saȳt / & he loued moche also saynt Edmund the kyng / & often he gaue grete gyftes to the hous / & made it ryche. And whan he had regned .xx. yere he dyed / & lyeth at Wynchestre.






¶ Anno dn̄i. M .xviij.


BEnedict{us} the .ix. was pope after Iohannes / & he was a grete le∣thour


/ & therfore he was dampned / & he appered to a certayne man vnder a mer∣uaylous fygure & an horryble. His heed & his tayle was lyke an asse / that other part of his body lyke a beer. And he sayd to this mā to whom he appered. Be not aferde / for I was a man as ye be now / but for my beestly lyuynge whā I was pope I appere now lyke a beest. ¶ In this mānes tyme was grete diuisyon & sclaūdre to y
•
 chirche / for he was put out & in two tymes. And here Ptholomeus noteth y
t
 the pryde of bysshops had euer an euyl ende / & it was euer y
•
 occasyon of moche vnrest & batayle. ¶ Cōradus the fyrst was emperour after Hēry .xx. yere This mā made many lawes / & cōmaū∣ded peas to be kept moost straytly of ony man. But y
•
 erle of Ludolf was accused & he fledde frō his londe / & desyred more to lyue lyke a chorle than lyke a gentyl∣man / & yet meruaylously his sone was made emperour by y
•
 cōmaundement of god agaynst the wyl of Conradus. And at the last they were accorded / & he toke Conradus doughter to his wyfe.






¶ Of kynge Harold that had leuer go on fote than ryde on horsbacke.


THis Knoght of whome we haue spokē of before had two sones by his wyfe Emme / y
t
 one was called Har∣diknoght / & y
t
 other Harold / & he was so lyght on fote y
t
 men called hym comynly Harold hare fote. And this Harold was no thynge manerd after Knoght his fa∣der / for he set not by cheualry / curteysy / ne worship / but onely by his owne wyll. And he became so wicked y
t
 he exiled his moder Emme. And she went in to Flaū∣dres / & there dwelled w
t
 y
•
 erle / wherfore he & his broder hated echeother deedly. And whan he had regned ij. yere & more hedyed / & lyeth at West mynster.






¶ Of kynge Hardiknoght that was Haroldes broder.


AFter this Harold hare fote reg∣ned his broder Hardyknoght / a noble knight & a worthy / & moche loued cheualry and all maner of goodnes. And whan this Hardiknoght had regned a lytell whyle / he let vncouer his broder Harold / & smote of his heed / & made it to be cast in to a gonge / & the body in to Ta myse. And after came fysshers & toke y
•
 bedy with theyr nettes by nyght / & bare hym to saynt Clemētes chirche / & there buryed hym. Thus auenged hym Har∣diknoght on his broder. Thus kyng Har diknoght was so large a gyuer of meet & drynke / that his tables were set euery daye thre tymes full with ryall metes & drynkes for his meyny & for them that came to his courte. And this kyng Har∣diknoght sent after Emme his moder & made her to come agayn / for his broder Harold hare fote had dryuen her out of y
•
 lond through coūseyle of y
•
 erle Godwyn that than was the gretest lorde in Eng∣londe nexte the kynge / & that had moost rule / bycause he had spoused the dough∣ter of kyng Knoght begoten on his fyrst wyfe. And whan this quene was dry∣uen out of Englond & came to the erle of Flaundres that was called Baldewyne his cosyn foūde her there all thȳge that her neded / vnto the tyme that she went agayne in to Englonde / that the kynge Hardiknoght had sent for her that was her sone / and made her to come agayne with moche honour. This kyng Hardi∣knoght whan he had regned .v. yere he dyed / and lyeth at West mynster.






¶ Of the vylany that the Danes' dyd to the englysshmen / wherfore fro that tyme after was no Dane made kynge of this londe.



AFter the deth of this kyng Har∣diknoght for as moche as he ne had no chylde of his body begoten / the 
les and barons asseinbled and made a coūseyl / that neuer more after no man y
t
 was a Dane / though he were neuer so grete a man amonge them / he shold ne∣uer be kyng of Englonde for y
•
 despyte y
t
 they had done to englysshmen. For euer more before / yf the englyshmen & the da nes happened to mete vpō a brydge / the englyshmen shold not be so hardy to me∣ne a fote / but stande styll tyll the danes were passed forth. And more ouer yf the englyshmen had not bowed down theyr heedes to do reuerence vnto the danes / they sholde haue ben beten & defouled / & suche despytes & vylany dyd the danes to our englysshmē / wherfore they were driuen out of y
•
 londe after Hardiknogh∣tes deth. For they had no lorde y
•
 myght mayntayne them. And in this maner a∣uoyded the danes Englonde / that they neuer came agayn. The erles & barons by theyr comyn assent & counseyle sente vnto Normādy for to seke those two bre∣therne Alured and Edwarde that were dwellynge w
t
 the duke Rycharde y
•
 was theyr vncle / in entent for to crowne Alu∣red the elder broder / & make hym kyng of Englonde / & of this thynge to make an ende. The erles & barons made theyr othe / but the erle Godwyn of Westsex falsly & traytoursly thought to slee these two bretherne anone as they shold come in to Englond / in entent to make Harold his sone kynge / the whiche sone he had begoten on his wyfe kyng Hardiknogh tes doughter y
•
 was a dane. And so this Godwyn went pryuely to southhamton for to mete there with the two bretherne at theyr landynge. And thus it befell y
t
 the messengers y
t
 went in to Normandy foūde not but onely Alured that was y
•
 eldest broder. For Edwarde his broder was gone to Hungary for to speke with his cosyn Edwarde the outlawe y
•
 was Edmund Irensydes sone. The messen∣gers said to Aluted how y
•
 the erles & ba rons of Englond sent for hȳ / & y
•
 he shold boldly come in to Englōde & receyue the realme: for king Hardiknoght was deed & all the danes dryuen out of the londe.






¶ How Godwyn the fals traytour toke Alured vpon Gildesdown whan that he came from Normandye to be kynge of Englonde / & how he caused hym to be martyred in the yle of Ely.






WHan Alured herd these tydȳges he thāked god / & toke shyppyng with all y
•
 haste that he myght and passed the see and arryued at south hamton there Godwyn y
•
 fals traytour was. And whan this traytour sawe y
•
 he was comen / he welcomed hym & re∣ceyued hym with moche ioye / & sayd y
t
 he 
wold
 lede hym to London where as all the barons of Englonde hym abode to make hym theyr kynge. And so they went on theyr waye towarde London. And whan they came on Gyldesdowne tho sayd y
•
 traytour Godwyn vnto Alu∣red.


Take hepe aboute you bothe on the lefte syde & on the ryght syde / & of all ye shal be kyng / & of suche an hondred mod Now forsothe sayd Alured / I behyght you and yf I be kyng / I shall ordeyne & make suche lawes / wherof god & man shall be well apayed. Now had the tray tour cōmaūded all his men that were w
t
 hym / that whan they were comen vpon Gyldesdown that they shold slee all that were in Aluredes company / that came with hym from Normādy / & after that take Alured & lede hym in to y
•
 yle of Ely and after put out bothe his eyen of his heed / & afterward brynge hym to deth. And so they dyd / for they slewe all y
•
 com¦pany that were there / the nombre of. xij gentylmen y
•
 were comen with Alured frō Normandy / & after they toke Alured & in the yle of Ely they put out his eyen & rent his wombe / & toke y
•
 chefe of his bowels / & put a stake in to the groūde / & an ende of the bowels fastened therto / & with nedyls of yren they pricked y
•
 good thylde / & so made hym to go aboute the stake tyll y
t
 all his bowels were drawen out of his body / & so dyed Alured there through treason of the erle Godwyne. Whan the lordes of Englond had herde and wyst how Alured that sholde haue ben theyr king was put to deth through the fals traytour Godwyne / they were wonders wroth / & swore bytwene them god & his holy name / that he sholde dye a worse deth thā dyd Edryth of stration y
•
 had betrayed his lorde Edmund Iren syde / & they wold haue put hym to deth but the traytour fledde thens in to Den¦marke / & there helde hym .iiij. yere and more / & lost all his londe in Englonde.


SIluester the thyrde was pope af¦ter Benedictus. This Siluester was chosen / & Benedict was expulsed. And afterwarde was Siluester expul∣sed & Benedict was put vp agayn. And after he was put out / & Gregory was made pope / & he was but symple let∣tred man / and therfore he chose an other pope to be cōsecrate w
t
 hym. And whan many men were dyspleased with this guydyng of two popes / the thyrde was brought in / the whiche sholde occupy y
•
 place of bothe y
•
 two. And so they stroue amonge them selfe. But Henry the em∣perour than came to Rome and deposed them all / and made Clement the second pope / whome he made anone to crowne hym. And he sayd to the Romayns they sholde neuer w
t
out his assent chose pope And so .v. beynge popes / the syxth was put in. But many men saye this Grego ry was an holy man. ¶ Damasus the second was after Clement .xxiij. dayes. This man was an vsurper of y
•
 popery che / & he dyed sodeynly. And anone the Romayns asked to haue a pope / & that the Almayns sholde haue none / for they were so harde herted that they myght not enclyne to the entent of y
•
 emperout the whiche sayd there sholde be no pope chosen but yf he wolde be of counseyle of the eleccyon. But for all that they put in this holy man Leo / and after he had of that conscyence / & refused it. And anone he was chosen by y
•
 comyn assent. This Leo put Chryst in the forme of a lasar in to his owne bedde / and on the morowe he founde no thynge there.






¶ Of saynt Edwarde the confessour that was Aluredes broder / and how he was kynge of Englonde.


ANd whā this was done / all the barons of englond sent another tyme in to Normandy y
•
 Edward sholde come in to englond with moche 
onout. And this Edwarde in his chyldhode lo∣ued 
 hey god & hym dradde / and in


honeste & clennes ladde his lyfe / & hated synne as deth. And whan he was crow ned & anoynted w
t
 a ryall power / he for∣gate not his good maners & condicyons that he fyrst vsed / & forgate not all good customes for no maner honour / ne for no rychesse / ne for no maner hygnes. But euer more & more gaue hym to goodnes & well loued god & holy chirche passyng all other maner thynge. And poore men also he loued / & helde them as they had ben his owne bretherne / & to them ofte he gaue grete almes w
t

¶ Of the fyrst specyall loue that god shewed to saynt Edward lyuynge.


IT befell on a daye as he went frō the chirche of westmynster / & had herde masse of saynt Iohn y
e
 euangelyst for as moche as he loued saȳt Iohn the euangelist more specyally after god and our lady / than he dyd ony other saynt. And so there came to hym a pylgrym / & prayed hym for y
e
 loue of god & our lady & saynt Iohn the euangelyst some good for to gyue hym. And the kyng pryuely toke his rynge of his fynger / y
t
 no man perceyued it / & gaue it to the pilgrym / & he it receyued & went thens. This king Edward made all y
e
 good lawes of Eng∣londe / that yet ben moost vsed & holden. And he was so mercyable and so full of pyte / that no man myght be more.






¶ How the erle Godwyn came agayne in to Englonde / and had agayne all his londe / and afterwarde saynt Edwarde wedded his doughter.


WHan the erle Godwyn that was dwellynge in Denmark had mo∣che herde of the goodnes of kynge Ed∣warde / & that he was full of mercy and pyte / he thought y
t
 he wolde go agayne in to Englond for to seke & to haue grace of the good kyng Edward that so mer∣cy full was that he myght haue agayn his londe in peas. And arayed hym as moche as he myght & put hym towarde the see & came in to Englonde to London where y
e
 kynge was that tyme & all the lordes of Englonde & helde a parlyamēt Godwyn sent to them y

 kynges grace for hym / & that he wolde graunte him his peas & his lōde. The lordes lad hȳ before y
e
 kyng to seke his grace. And anone as y
e
 kyng sawe hym / he appeled hym of treason / & of the deth of Alured his broder / & these wordes to hym sayd Traytour Godwyn I the appele that thou hast betrayed & slayne my broder Alured. Certes syr sayd Godwyn saue your grace & your peas & your lordshyp I neuer betrayed hym / 
e yet lewe hȳ. And therfore I put me in reward of the caurte. Now fayre lordes sayd y
e
 kynge / ye that be my lyeges / erles & barons of the londe y
t
 here ben assembled / full well ye herde myn appele / & the answere also of Godwyn / & therfore I wyll that ye awarde & do ryght. The erles & barons than gadred them all togyder to do this awarde by themselfe / & so they spake dy uersly among them / for some sayd there was neuer alyaūce by homage serment seruyce / nor by lordshyp bytwene God∣wyn & Alured / for whiche thynge they myght hym drawe. And at the last they deuysed & demed / that he shold put hym in y
e
 kynges mercy all togyder. Thā sna ke the erle Leuerike of Couentre a good man to god & to all the worlde / & told his reason in this maner and sayd. The erle Godwyn is y
e
 best frended man of Eng∣londe after y
e
 kyng / & well myght it not be gaynsayd / that without cou
se yle of Godwyn Alured was neuer put to deth


wherfore I awarde as touchynge my parte / that hymself & his sone & euery of vs .xii. erles that ben his frendes go be∣fore the kynge / charged with as moche golde & syluer as we may bere bytwene our handes / prayenge the kynge to for∣gyue his euyll wyll to the erle Godwyn and receyue his homage / & yelde agayn his londe. And they accorded vnto that awarde / and came euery of them with golde & syluer as moche as they myght bere bytwene theyr handes before the kynge / and there sayd the forme and the maner of theyr accorde & of theyr awar∣de. The kyng wolde not them gaynsaye but as moche as they had ordeyned he graūted and cōfermed. And so was the erle Godwyn accorded with the kynge / and had agayne all his londes. And af∣terward he bare hym so well & so wyse∣ly / that the kynge loued hym wonders moche / & with hym he was full preuy. And within a lytell tyme they loued so moche that y
e
 kynge spoused Godwyns doughter / and made her quene. And ne∣uertheles though the kyng had a wyfe yet he lyued euer in chastite and clennes of body w
t
out ony flesshely dede doynge with his wyfe. And y
e
 quene also in her halfe ladde an holy lyfe two yere / & dyed And afterwarde the kynge lyued all his lyfe without ony wyfe. The kyng gaue the erledome of Oxford to Harolde that was Godwyns sone / & made hym erle. And so well they were beloued / bothe y
e
 fader and he / & were so preuy with the kynge / y
t
 they myght do by ryght what thynge they wolde. For agaynst ryght wold he no thynge do for no maner man so good and true he was of conscyence. And therfore our lorde Iesu Chryst spe∣cyall loue shewed to hym.






¶ How kynge Edwarde sawe 
wyne kynge of Denmarke drowned in the see in the tyme of the leuacyon of the sacra∣ment as he stode and herde masse.


IT befell vpon a whytsondaye as kynge Edwarde herde his masse in the grete chirche of Westmynster at the leuacion of Iesu Christes body: & as all men were gadred in the chirche / and came nigh the awter for to se y

 all his power for to haue comen in to Englond to warre vpon vs / & I sawe hym & all his folke drowned in the see / & all this I sawe in the leuacyon of Chrystes body bytwene the preestes hādes / & I had therof so grete wye that I myght not my laughter withholde. And the erle Leuerich stode besyde hym at the leuacion / & openly sawe the forme of breed turne in to y
e
 lykenes of a yonge childe / & toke vp his ryght hande & blys∣sed the kynge / & afterwarde y

¶ How the rynge that saynt Edwarde had gyuen to a poore pylgrym for y
e
 loue of god and saynt Iohn the euangelyst came agayne to kynge Edwarde.


THis noble man saynt Edwarde regned .xiii. yere. And thus it be fell vpon a tyme or he dyed / y
e
 two men of Englond were gone in to y
e
 holy londe


and had done theyr pilgrymage / & were goynge agayne in to theyr owne coūtree where they came fro. And as they went in the waye / they mette a pilgrym that curteysly salewed them / & asked of them in what londe and in what coūtree they were borne. And they sayd in Englonde Than asked he who was kyng of Eng∣londe. And they answered and sayd / the good king Edward. Fayre frendes sayd the pylgrym / whan that ye come in to your coūtree agayne / I praye you that ye wyll go vnto kyng Edwarde / & greet hym oftentymes in my name / & oftenty mes him thanke of his grete curteysy y
t
 he to me hath done / & namely for y
e
 ryng y
t
 he gaue me whan he had herde masse at Westmynster for saynt Iohns loue y
e
 euāgelyst. And than toke y
e
 rynge & toke it to the pylgryms & sayd. I praye you go & bere this ryng / & take it vnto kyng Edward / & tell hym that I sende it hym and a full ryche gyfte I wyll gyue hym For vpō the .xij. daye he shal come to me & euermore dwell in blysse w
t
outen ende. Syr sayd y
e
 pilgryms / what man be ye and in what coūtree is your dwellynge. Fayre frendes sayd he / I am Iohn the euangelyst / & I am dwellynge with al∣myghty god / & your kynge Edward is my frende / & I loue hym in specyall for bycause that he hath euermore lyued in clennes & is a clene mayd / & I praye you my message to fulfyll as I haue sayd. Whan saȳt Iohn y
e
 euāgelyst had thus charged them / sodeynly he voyded out of bothe theyr sightes. Than thanked y
e
 pylgryms almyghty god & went forth theyr waye. And whan they had gone two or thre myle they begā to ware we∣ry / & set them down for to rest them / & so they fell on slepe. And whan they had well slepte / one of them awoke & lyft vp his heed & loked aboute & sayd to his fe∣lowe. Aryse vp and go we in our waye. What sayd that our felowe to that other where be we now. Certes sayd y
e
 other / it semeth me y
t
 this is not y
e
 same coūtre that we layde vs 
owne in for to rest & slepe. For we were from Ierusalem but thre myles. They toke vp theyr handes and blyssed them / & went forth on theyr waye / & as they went they sawe shepes herdes goyng w
t
 theyr shepe that spake none other lāguage but englisshe. Good frendes sayd one of y
e
 pylgryms / what coūtre is this / & who is lord therof. And anone the shepeherdes answered & sayd This is the coūtree of Kent in Englond of the whiche the good kynge Edward is lorde of. Than the pilgryms thanked almyghty god & saynt Iohn y
e
 euange∣lyst / & went forth on theyr waye & came to Caunterbury / & from thens to Lon∣don / & there they foūde the kynge. And tolde hym all from y
e
 begynnynge to the endynge / as moche as saynt Iohn had charged them / & of all thȳges how they had spēdde by y
e
 waye / & toke y
e
 rynge to kyng Edward / & he receyued it / & than∣ked almyghty god & saynt Iohn y
e
 euan gelyst. And than made hym redy euery daye from daye to daye to departe out of this lyfe whan god wold send for hym.






¶ How saynt Edwarde dyed on the .xij. daye.


ANd after it befel thus on Chryst masse euen as the holy man Ed∣ward was at goddes seruyce for to here matyns of y

cōforte amonge all that were in the hall was turned in to care & sorowe / bycause they drad to lese theyr good lorde y
e

e
 euange∣lyst that came nexte the kynge receyued his ryghtes of holy chirche / as it befal∣leth to euery chrysten man / & abode the mercy & the wyll of god. And y
e
 two pyl∣gryms he let come before hym / & gaue them ryche gyftes & betoke them to god And also y
e
 abbot of Westmynster he let come before hym / & toke hym that ryng in the honour of god & saynt Mary & of saynt Iohn the euangelyst. And the ab∣bot toke & put it amonge other relykes / so that it is at Westmynster & euer shall be. And so laye y
e
 kynge seke tyll the .xij. euen / and than dyed the good kyng Ed∣ward at Westmynster / & there he lyeth. For whose loue god hath shewed many a fayre myracle. And this was in y

Ictor the seconde was pope af∣ter Leo / & lytell of hȳ is wryten. ¶ Henry the seconde was emperour af∣ter the first Henry .xvij. yere. This man was cosyn to Conrade / & he was borne in a wode / and twyes taken to be slayne whā he was a childe / but god defended hȳ euermore. Whan he was made em∣perour he made a monastery in y
e
 same place in the wode where he was borne. This man was a vicyous man / and he entred in to Ytaly / & there he toke Pan∣dulphus y

 pope Stephen by strengthe / & kepte it .ix. monethes / & than decessed. ¶ Henry the thyrde was emperour after Henry the second. This Henry was an vnquyete man / & many tymes troubled the holy man Gregory the .vij. And fyrst he asked forgyuenes & was assoyled / but he perseuered not / but brought in an other pope agaynst hym / and sayd he was an heretyke. And Gre¦gory cursed hym. And the chosers of the emperour chose the duke of Saxon for to be emperour / whome this Henry in batayle ouercame. And than he came to Rome with his pope / and pursued pope Gregory & the cardynals also. And than anone Robert y
e
 kynge of Naples droue hym thens / & delyuered the pope & his cardynals. Neuerthelesse yet he was a man of grete almes / and .xij. tymes he fought in batayle. And at y
e
 last he dyed wretchedly. For he was put downe by his owne sone. For so as he dyd to other men / so was he done to. ¶ Nycolas the seconde was pope after Benedicte two yere. This Nycolas called a coūseyle a∣gaynst the archedeken of Turonosens whiche was an heretyke / & he taught agaynst the fayth. For he erred in the sa crament / & after he was cōuerted & was an holy man / but he coude neuer cōuerte his discyples. ¶ Nota. ¶ Alexander the seconde was pope after hȳ .xij. yere. This Alexander was an holy man / & he ordeyned that vnder payne of cursynge that no man shold here a preestes masse whome they knewe had a

¶ How Harolde that was Godwyns sone was made kynge / & how he esca∣ped fro the duke of Normandy.


Whan 
aȳt Edward was gone out of this worlde / and was passed to god / & worthely buryed as it appertey∣ned to suche a grete lorde for to be. The


barons of the londe wolde haue had Ed¦ward Helingus / sone to Edward y

And this Harold wende that duke Willyam wolde haue ben auenged on hȳ / bycause that Haroldes fader had let slee Alured saynt Edwardes broder / & pryncypally bycause Alured was sone to quene Em∣ma that was Rychardes moder duke of Normandy y
•
 was grandfader to duke Willyam. Neuerthelesse he dyd not so / for as moche as Harold was a noble & a wyse knight / & that his fader & he were accorded w
t
 saynt Edwarde / therfore he wolde not mysdo hym / but alowed all thynge ordeyned bytwene them. Harold by his good wyll sware vpon a boke & vpon holy saintes that he shold spouse & wedde duke Wyllyams doughter after the deth of saynt Edward / & y
•
 he sholde do his besy cure to saue & kepe y
•
 realme of Englonde vnto y

 profyte & auaūtage of duke William. And whā Harold had thus made his othe vnto duke William he let hym go free out of pryson / & gaue hȳ many ryche gyftes. And than he de∣parted thens & came in to Englond / and anone dyd in this maner whā saynt Ed¦ward was deed as a fals forsworne man let crowne hymselfe kynge of Englonde and falsly brake the couenaunt y

 londe yf that he myght. ¶ And in y

 duke asked hȳ of these thre thynges / yf that he wold haue his doughter to wyfe as he had promysed & sworne his othe / or that he wolde holde the londe of hym in truage / or that he wold determyne this thynge in batayle This Harold was a proude man and a stronge / & trusted moche in his strength and fought with y
e
 duke Willyam & his people. But Harolde and his men were discomfyted in that batayle / & hymselfe there was slayn. And this batayle was ended at Toubrydge in the seconde yere of his regne / vpon saynt Calixtes daye / and so he was buryed at waltham.






¶ Of kynge Willyam bastard / & how he gouerned hym well and wysely / and of the warre bytwene hym & the kynge of Fraunce.

¶ Of kynge Willyam Rous that was kynge Wyllyam bastardes sone / that destroyed townes & houses of relygyon


for to make the newe forest.


ANd after this Willyam bastard regned his sone Willyam Rous This Willyam was a wonders cōtra∣tyous man to god & holy chirche / & let a∣mende & make y
•
 towne of Cardeis / that the paynyms had destroyed. This king Willyam destroyed holy chirche & theyr possessions in what parte he myght fyn be them. And therfore there was so mo∣che debate bytwene hym and the arche∣bysshop of Caunterbury Ancelme / by∣cause he cepreued hȳ of his wyckednes that he destroyed holy chitche. And for y
•
 cause y
•
 kynge bare to hym grete wrath and therfore exiled hym out of this lōde And the archebysshop than went to the courte of Rome / & there dwelled with y
•
 pope. ¶ And this kynge made the newe forest / and kest downe & destroyed .xxvj. townes / and .lxxx. houses of religion / all for to make his forest longet & broder / & became wonders proude & gladde of his wode & forest / & of y
•
 wylde beestes that were within it / that it was manuayle to wyte / so that men called hym kepet of wodes & pastours. And the longer that helyued / the more wycked he became / bothe to god & to all holy chirche / & to all his nien. ¶ And this kyng let make the grete hall of Westmynster. So vpon a day at whytsontyde he helde therin his fyrst feest / & he loked aboute hym & sayd that y
•
 hall was to lytell by y
•
 halfedele. And at the last he became so cōtraryous that all thynge y
•
 pleased god displeased hym / & all thynge y
•
 god loued he hated de
dly. ¶ And so it befell that he dremed vpon a night alytel or y
•
 he dyed / that he was let blode / & b
dde a grete quantite of blode / & a streme of it 
epte 
n hye to∣warde hellen more than 
 
deed fa∣dom / & the clerenes of the daye was 
 ned vnto 
yght & derknes / & the 
a∣ment also. And whan he awoke he had grete drede / so that he wyst not what to do / & tolde his dreme to men of his coun seyle / & said that he had grete drede / and supposed that to hym was some mys∣chaunce to come. ¶ And y
•
 second nyght before a monke dremed of the housholde that the kyng went in to a chirche with moche people / & he was so proude / that he despysed all y
•
 people that were with hym / and that he toke the ymage of the crucyfyxe and shamefully bote it with his tethe. And the crucifyxe mekely suf∣fred all that he dyd. But the kynge as a wood man rent of the armes of the cru∣cyfyxe / and kest it vnder his feet and de∣fouled it / and threwe it all abrode. And a grete flame of fyre came out of the crucy¦fyxe mouth. Of the whiche dreme ma∣ny men had grete meruayle & wonder. ¶ The good man that had dremed this straūge dreme tolde it to a knyght that was moost preuy with the kynge of all men / & the knyght was called Hanum∣des. Soone the monke and he tolde the dreme vnto the kynge / and sayd that it sholde betoken other thynge than good. And neuertheles y
•
 king laughed therac twyes or thryes / and lytell set therby / & thought that he wolde go & hunte and playe in the forest. And men counseyled hym that he sholde not go that daye for no maner thynge / ne come in y
•
 wode / so that he abode at home before meet. But anone as he had eten / no man myght let hym but that he wolde go vnto y
•
 wode for to haue his dysporte. And so it befell that one of his knyghtes that hyghte Walter Tyrell wolde haue shorte to a grete harte / & his arowe glansed vpon a braunche / and through mysauenture smote the kynge vnto the herte. And so he fell downe deed to the grounde with∣out ony worde spekynge / and so ended his lyfe days. And it was no mecuayle


for the daye that he dyed he had let to 
erme the archebysshopryche of Caun∣terbury / and .xij. abbeys also / and euer more dyd grete destruccyon to holy chir∣che through wrongfull takynge and as∣kyng. For no man durst withstāde that he wold haue done / & of his 
ewdnes he wolde neuer w

¶ Of king Hēry beauclerke y

ANd whan this Willyam Rous was deed / Henry beauclerk his broder was made kynge / bycause that William Rous had no childe 
 of his body / & this Henry Beauclerk was crowned kyng at London y
e
 fourth daye after that his broder was deed / that is is saye / the fyfth daye of August. ¶ And anone as Ancelme y
t
 was archebysshop of Caunterbury beynge at the courte of Rome herde tell y

 duke went home agayn in to Normādy. And whan the kynge had regned foure yere there arose a grete debate bytwene hym and y
e
 archebysshop of Caūterbury An∣celme. For bycause that y
e
 archebysshop wolde not graū
e hym to take talage of chirches at his wyll / & therfore the ar∣chebysshop Ancelme went agayne ouer the see vnto the courte of Rome / & there he dwelled w

And whan two yere were gone / through the entycement of the deuyll & of lewde men a grete debate arose bytwene the kynge and the duke / so that through counseyle the kynge went ouer the see in to Nor∣mandy.

e
 erle had spoused his syster dame Maude. And for this cause the king of Fraūce dyd moche sorowe to Normandy. Wherfore y
e
 kynge of Eng∣londe was wonders wrothe / & in ha
 went ouer the see with a grete power / and came in to Normandy for to defende that londe. And y
e
 warre bytwene them lasted two yere / tyll at the last they two fought togyder / and the king of Fraūce was dyscomfyted / and escaped awaye with moche payne / and the moost parte of his men were discomfyted and taken And the kyng dyd with them his plea∣sure / & some of them he let go frely / and some he let put to deth.

¶ Of kyng Rychard that conquered all the holy that chrysten men had lost.


AFter this kynge Henry regned Rychard his sone / whiche was a stoute man & a stronge and a worthy and also bolde. And he was crowned at Westmynster of the archebysshop Bal∣dewyn of Caūterbury / the thyrde daye of September. And the seconde yere of his regne kynge Rychard hymselfe and Baldewyn the archebysshop of Caun∣terbury / and Hubert-bysshop of Salys∣bury


/ and Randulferle of Glocestre / and many other lordes of Englonde went in to the holy londe. And in that vyage de∣cessed the archebysshop of Caūterbury. And kynge Rycharde went before in to the holy londe / and rested not tyl that he came forth in his waye vnto Cipers / & toke it with grete force. And after that kynge Rychard went forth toward the holy londe / and gate there as moche as the chrysten men had lost before / & con∣quered the londe agayne through grete myght / saue onely the holy crosse. And whan kynge Rycharde came to the cite of Acres for to gete the cite / there arose a grete debate bytwene hym & the kynge of Fraūce / so that the kynge of Fraunce went agayn in to Fraūce / & was wroth towarde kyng Rychard. But yet for all that or kynge Rycharde wente agayne he toke the cyte of Acres. And whan he had taken it / he dwelled in y
e
 cite a whyle But to hym came tydynges that y
e
 erle Iohn of Oxford his broder wolde haue seased all Englonde in to his handes / & Normandy also / & wolde crowne hym selfe kynge of all the londe. Whan kyng Rychard herde these tydynges he came toward Englonde with all y
e
 spede that he myght. But the duke of Ostryche mette with hym / & toke hym & brought hym vnto y
e
 emperour of Almayn. And the emperour put hym in prison. And af terward he was delyuered for an huge raūsom / that is to saye / an hondred. M. pounde. For the whiche raunsom to be payed eche other chalice of Englōd was molten & made in to money. And all the monkes of the ordre of Cisteaux gaue all theyr bokes through out all Englonde for to be solde / for to paye the raunsom.






¶ How kynge Rychard came agayn from y
e
 holy londe / and auenged hym on his enemyes.


WHyles this kyng Rycharde was in pryson / the kynge of Fraunce warred vpon hȳ strongly in Nor mandy. And Iohn his broder warred vpon hym in Englond. But y
e
 bysshops and barons of Englond withstode hym with all y
e
 power that they myght gete and toke the castell of Wyndsore & other castelles. And the foresayd Iohn sawe that he had no might ne power agaynst the barons of Englond for to fyght but anone wente hym ouer the see vnto the kynge of Fraūce. And whan kynge Ry∣charde came out of pryson and was de∣lyuered & came in to Englond anone af∣ter Candelmasse in grete haste he went vnto Notyngham / & the castell of No∣tingham to hym was yelded. And than discomfyted he his broder Iohn and all those that held with hym. And after he went vnto the cyte of Wynchestre and there he let hym to be crowned kynge of Englonde. And after he went vnto Nor mandy for to warre vpon the kynge of Fraūce. And whan the kyng of Fraūce herde that / he came with fyur hondred knyghtes towarde Gysors. And kynge Rycharde mette hym and wolde haue gyuen hym batayle. But the kynge of Fraūce anone fledde / and an hondred of his knyghtes were taken & two hon∣dre horses that were trapped with y
en ¶ And anone after went kyng Rychard for to besyege the castell Gayllard. And vpon a daye as he rode by the castell for to take auysement of the castell one of the arbalastres smore hym with a qua∣rell that was enuenymed. And kyng Ri¦chard drewe out the shafte of the quarell but the quarelles heed abode styll in his heed / and it began for to rankle / that he myght not helpe hymselfe ne meue his armes. And whan he wyst that he had dethes wounde vpon hym / and that he myght not be hole for no maner thynge


he cōmaūded anone all his men sharply to assayle the castell / so y
e
 the castell was takē or y
e
 he dyed / & so māly his men dyd that all were taken y
e
 were w
t
in. And the kyng dyd w
t
 them his wyl / & cōmaūded his men to brȳge before hȳ the man y
e
 so had woūded hym. And whan he came before hym the kynge asked hym what was his name. And he said my name is Bertrā gurdon. Wherfore (sayd y
e
 king) hast y
e
 slayne me / syth I dyd y
e
 neuer no harme. Syr sayd he / though ye dyd me neuer none harme / ye your selfe w
t
 your handes slewe my fader & my broder / & I therfore haue quytte you now your tra∣uayle. Than sayd kynge Rychard / he y
e
 dyed vpon y
e
 crosse to brȳge mānes soule fro y
e
 paynes of hell / forgyue y
e
 my deth / & I also forgyue it the. Than he cōmaū ded y
e
 no man 
shold
 mysdo hym. But for all y
e
 kynges defending / some of his men folowed hym / & priuely slewe hym. And the .vj. daye after y
e
 kyng dyd shryue hȳ & sore repented hym of his mysdedes / & was houseled & anoynted / & had regned but .ix. yere & .xxxix. wekes / & dyed and lyeth besyde his fader at Foūteuerard.


HEnricus the fyfth was emperour viij. yere. This Henry was sone to Frederik / & he wedded Constans the kinges doughter of Cecile. And through the occasion of her he subdued all y
e
 king¦dom of Apulie / & droue out all y
e
 inhaby∣taūtes therof. ¶ Celestinus the thyrde was pope after Clemēs almost .iij. yere This man was crowned on eester daye & the day folowyng he crowned Henry y
e
 emperour / & he made a palays at saynt Peters / & decessed. ¶ Innocencius the thyrde was pope after hym .viij. yere & v. monethes. This mā was well lettred & he made a boke of the wretchednes of mānes condicyon. And he made speculū misse / and he made many cōstitucyons. This man dampned the boke of Iohn Ioachim / the whiche he made agaynst mayster Pyers Lombard the maker of the sentence. ¶ This tyme decessed the emperour Henry / and the princes of Al∣mayn dyscorded / for some chose Otto / & some chose Philip broder to Hēry. Thā Philyp was falsly slayne / & Otto was crowned of Innocent in Fraūce / y
e
 whi∣che anone gaue batayle to the Romains bycause they gaue hym no due honour. And for y
e
 cause agaynst the popes wyll he toke y
e
 kyngdom of Apulie from Fre∣deryk / wherfore the pope cursed hym. Than after the fourth yere of his regne the prynces of Almayn made Frederyk emperour / and victoryously he subdued Otto. ¶ Wyllyam of Parys this tyme began the ordre of y
e
 freres Austyns / the whiche ben called freres mendicantes. ¶ Frāciscus an ytalyan a man of grete perfeccyon / and an ensample to many a man dyd many a myracle this tyme / & he ordeyned the freres minours. ¶ And the .vj. yere of pope Innocent the thyrd the ordre of the freres prechours began vnder Dominik / but it myght not be cō¦fermed tyll the fyrst yere of Honorius.






¶ Of kynge Iohn that in the fyrst yere of his regne lost all Normandy.


Bycause kyng Rychard had none heyre sone ne doughter after his deth: they made Iohn his broder king / & crowned hȳ at Westmynster by Hubert the archebysshop of Caunterbury. And whan he began to regne / he became so meruaylous a man y
e
 he went ouer in to Normandy / & warred vpon y
e
 kynge of Fraūce. And so longe they warred togy der tyll at y
e
 last kyng Iohn lost all Nor∣mandy & Angeo / wherfore he was sore anoyed: & it was no meruayle. Than let he assemble before hȳ at London arche∣bysshops


/ bisshops / abbottes & pryours erles & barons / & helde there a grete par lyament / & asked there of the clergy the tenth of euery chirche of Englonde for to conquere Normandy and Angeo agayn that he had lost. They wolde not graūte that thȳge / wherfore he was wonders wroth. ¶ In y
e
 same tyme dyed Hubert Than the pryour & the couent of Caun∣terbury chose agaynst the kynges wyll to be archebysshop mayster Stephen of Langton a good clerke / that dwelled at the courte of Rome / and sent to the pope theyr eletcyon. And the pope confermed it / & sacred hym at Viterbi. Whan the kynge wyst of these tydynges / he was wonders wrothe / & droue the pryour & the couēt fro Caūterbury / & exiled them out of the londe / & cōmaūded y
e
 no lettre nor cōmaūdement that came fro Rome sholde be receyued ne pleted in Englōde. Whan y
e
 pope herd this / he sent to kyng Iohn his lettres / & prayed hȳ louyngly to receyue Stephen the archebisshop of Caūterbury to his chirche / & suffre the pryour & his monkes to come agayne to theyr owne dwellynge. But the kynge wolde not graūte it for no thynge.






¶ How kyng Iohn wolde no thynge do for y
e
 popes cōmaūdement / wherfore all Englonde was enterdyted & suspended.


ANd at the last y
e
 pope sent by his auctorite / & enioyned to the bys∣shops of Englonde / y
e
 yf the kyng wolde not receyue the pryour of Caūterbury & his monkes / that they shold do generall enterdytyng through out all Englonde & graūted full power to foure bysshops to pronoūce the enterdytynge yf it were nede. The fyrst was bysshop Wyllyam of London / & that other bisshop Eustace of Ely / the thyrde was bysshop Walter of Wynchestre / & y
e
 fourth was bysshop Gyles of Herford / & these .iiij. bysshops prayed y
e
 kyng knelynge on theyr knees & sore wepyng that he wold do y
e
 popes cōmaūdement / & shewed hym the popes bulles of y
e
 enterd
ȳg. But for no prayer y
e
 they myght praye he wolde not cōsent therto. wherfore y
e
 bisshops seynge this departed thens / & on y
e
 morowe of y
e
 An∣nūciacyon of our lady they pronouced y
e
 generall enterdytyng through all Eng∣londe / so y
e
 the chirche dores were shette. Whan y
e
 enterdytyng was pronoūced y
e
 kyng for angre toke the foure bysshops londes in to his handes / & all y
e
 clergy of englōde / & ordeyned men to kepe it / y
e
 the clerkes myght not haue theyr lyuynge. Wherfore y
e
 bysshops cursed all them y
e
 shold medle w
t
 the goodes of holy chirche agaynst y
e
 wyll of y
e
 owners. Than the iiij. bysshops seynge y
e
 malyce of y
e
 kyng went ouer y
e
 see to Rome & came to y
e
 ar∣chebysshop of Caūterbury / & tolde hȳ all thyng. And y
e
 archebysshop bad them re¦turne agayn to Caūterbury / & he wolde eyther come or sende to them in his stede y
e
 shold do as moche as yf he hȳself were there. And whan y
e
 bysshops herde this they returned agayne in to Englonde / & came to Caūterbury. The tydynges ca∣me to y
e
 kyng y
e
 the bysshops were come agayn to Caūterbury / & hymself might not come thyder y
e
 tyme / he sente thyder bysshops / erles & abbots for to treate w
t
 them y
e
 the kyng sholde receyue y
e
 arche∣bysshop Stephen / & the pryour & all the monkes of Caūterbury / & y
e
 he shold ne∣uer after y
e
 tyme no thynge take of holy chirche agaynst y
e
 wyll of them y
e
 oweth the goodes / & y
e
 the kyng shold make full amendes to them / of whom he had ony goodes takē / & y
e
 holy chirche shold haue all fraūchyse / as ferforth as they had in saynt Edwardes tyme the confessour.






¶ How Stephen of Langton came a∣gayn in to Englond through y
e
 popes cō¦maūdement / & how he went agayne.








Whan the fourme of accordement was thus ordeyned / it was in a payre of endentures / & they put theyr seales to y
•
 one part / & they y
•
 came in the kynges name put theyr seales to that other parte of the endentures / and foure bysshops a fore sayd toke that one parte of the endentures to them / & that other parte they bare w
t
 them to shewe to the kyng. ¶ Whan the kynge sawe y
e
 forme & vnderstode it / he helde hym full wel apayed of al maner thȳges as they had ordeyned / sauynge as touchynge to make restitucyon agayne of the goodes to that thynge he wold not accorde / & so he sent worde agayne to the foure vys∣shops y
•
 they sholde put out y
•
 one poynt of restitucion. But they answered y
t
 they wold not put out one worde. Than sent the kyng to y
e
 archebysshop by the foure bisshops y
t
 he shold come to Caūterbury for to speke w
t
 hym there / & sent to hym safeconduyt vnder pledges / y
•
 is to saye his iustices Gilbert Poiteuin / William de la Brener / & Iohn fitz Hugh / that in theyr cōduyt safely he sholde come / & go agayn at his own wyll. And in this ma ner the archebysshop Stephen came to Caunterbury. Whan the archebysshop was comen / the kyng came to Chilham for he wolde come no nere Caūterbury at y
•
 tyme. But he sent by his tresourer bysshop of Wynchestre that he sholde do out of the endentures the clause of resti∣tucyon for to make of y
e
 goodes. And the archebysshop made his othe y
•
 he wolde not do out one worde therof / ne yet chaū ge of that the bysshops had spoken & or∣deyned. And than y
e
 archebysshop went agayn to Rome w
t
out ony more doynge. ¶ Kyng Iohn was than more angryer than euer he was before / and let make a comyn crye through out all Englonde that all those y
t
 had holy chirches rentes & went ouer y
e
 see / that they sholde come agayn in to Englonde at a certayn daye or els they sholde lese all theyr rentes for euer more / & that he cōmaūded to euery sheryue through out all Englonde / that they sholde enquyre yf ony bysshop / ab∣bot / pryour / or ony other prelate of holy chirche / from that daye afterwarde re∣ceyue ony cōmaundement that cometh fro the pope / that they sholde take y
e
 bo∣dy and brynge it before hym / and that they sholde take in the kynges handes all theyr lōdes of holy chirche that were gyuen to ony man by the archebysshop Stephen or by y
e
 pryour of Caūterbury from y
e
 tyme of y
e
 eleccyon of y
e
 archebys∣shop. And cōmaūded that all y

shold
 be casten downe to the grounde / and all solde.






¶ How kynge Iohn destroyed the ordre of Cisteaux.


ANd in the same yere the Irysshe men began to warre vpon kyng Iohn / & kynge Iohn ordeyned hym for to go in to Irlonde / & let arere an huge taxe through out all Englōde / that is to saye .xxxv. thousande marke. And thus


he sente through out all Englonde vnto the monkes of the ordre of Cisteaux that they sholde helpe hy o
 .vj. M. marke of syluer. And they answered & sayd y
t
 they durst no thynge do w
t
out theyr chefe ab∣bot of Cisteaux. Wherfore kynge John whan he came agayn from Irlond dyd them so moche sorow & care y
t
 they wyst not where to abyde / for he toke so moche raūsom of euery hous of them / that the somme amoūted to .ix. M. iij .C. marke / so that they were clene lost & destroyed / and voyded theyr houses & theyr londes through out all Englonde. And y
e
 abbot of Wauersay drad so moche his menace that he forsoke y
e
 abbey & went thens / & pryuely ordeyned hym ouer y
e
 see to the hous of Cisteaux. Whan the tydynges came to the pope that y
e
 kynge had done so moche malyce / than was he towarde the kyng full wroth / & sent two legates vnto y
e
 kynge / that one was called Pan∣dulf / & that other Durant / y
t
 they sholde warne the kynge in y
•
 popes name / that he sholde cesse of his persecucyon that he dyd vnto holy chirche / and amende the wronge & the trespace that he had done to the archebysshop of Caūterbury / & to the pryour & to the monkes of Caunter∣bury / and to all the clergy of Englonde / and that he sholde restore all the goodes agayne y
t
 he had taken of them agaynst theyr wyll / or els they sholde curse hym by name. And to do this thynge & to con ferme / the pope toke them his lettres in bulles patentes. These two legates ca∣me in to Englonde / & came to the kynge to Northamton / where as he helde his parlyamēt / & full curteysly they hym sa lewed & sayd. Syr we come fro y
e
 pope of Rome / the peas of holy chirche and the londe to amende. And we admonest you fyrst in the popes behalfe / that y
 make full restitucyon of the goodes y
•
 ye haue rauysshed & takē of holy chirche & of the londe / & that ye receyue Stephen arche∣bysshop of Caūterbury in to his dignite and the pryour of Caūterbury and his monkes / & that ye yelde agayne vnto y
•
 archebysshop all his londes and rentes without ony with holdyng. And syr yet more ouer / that ye shall make rest
yō vnto all holy chirche / wherof they shall holde them well apayed. Than answe∣red the kynge as touchynge y
•
 pryour & his mōkes of Caūterbury / all y
•
 ye haue sayd I wyll do gladly / & all thynge that ye wyll ordeyne. But as touchynge the archebysshop I shall tell you as it lyeth in my hert. That the archebysshop leue his archebysshopryche / & that the pope than for hym wolde praye / & than vpon auenture me sholde lyke some other bys∣shopryche to gyue hȳ in Englonde. And vpon this cōdicyon I wyll hym accepte and receyue. And neuerthelesse in Eng∣londe as archebysshop yf he abyde / he shall neuer haue so good safecōdu
te but that he shall be taken. Than sayd Pan∣dulf vnto the kynge. Syr holy chirche was neuer wont to discharge an arche∣bysshop without cause reasonable. But euer it hath be wont to chastyse pryn∣ces that to god and holy chirche were inobedyent. What how now quod the kynge / menace ye me. Nay sayd Pan∣dulf / but ye now openly haue tolde as it standeth in your herte. And to you we wyll tell what is the popes wyll. And thus it standeth that he hath you holly enterdyted & accursed / for the wronges that ye haue done to holy chirche & to y
e
 clergy. And for as moche as ye dwell & be in wyll to abyde in malyce & in wret∣chedues / & wyll not come out therof / 
 to none amendemēt. ye shall understāde that this tyme afterwarde y
e
 sentence is vpō you gyuē & holdeth stede & strength & vpon all tho that w
t
 you haue comoned before this tyme / whether they be 
es


barons or knyghtes / or ony other what so euer y
t
 they be / we them assoyle safely vnto this daye. And fro this tyme after∣warde of what condicyon someuer that they be / we them accurse that w
t
 you co∣mon ony worde / & we do sentence vpon them openly & specially. And we assoyle clene erles / barōs / knyghtes / & all other men of theyr homages / seruyce / & feau∣tees that they sholde vnto you do. And this thynge to cōferme we gyue playne power to the bysshop of Wynchestre & to the bysshop of Norwyche. And the same power we gyue in to Scotlonde to y
e
 bys¦shops of Rochestre & of Salysoury. And in Wales we gyue the same power to y
e
 bysshops of saynt Dauid & of Landaf & of saynt Asse. And more ouer we sende through out all chrystendom / that all y
e
 bysshops beyonde the see / that they do accurse all those that helpe you or y
t
 ony coūseyle gyueth you in ony maner nede that ye haue to do in ony parte of the worlde. And we assoyle all them also by the auctorite of the pope / and cōmaunde them also with you to fyght as w
t
 hym that is enemy to all holy chirche. Than answered the kynge / what may ye do more to me. Than answered Pandulf / we saye to you in the worde of god / that ye nor none heyre that ye haue / neuer af¦ter this day may be crowned. Thā sayd the kynge / by hym that is almyghty & I had wyst this afore or that ye came in to my londe that ye had brought me su∣che tydynges / I sholde haue made you tyde all one yere. Than sayd Pandulf / full well wende we at our fyrst comyng that ye wolde haue ben obedyent to god & holy chirche / & haue fulfylled y
e
 popes cōmaūdement / & now we haue shewed vnto you & pronounced the popes wyll as we were charged therwith. And as now ye haue sayd / that yf ye had wyst the cause of our comynge / that ye 
wold
 haue made vs ryde all an hole yere / and as well ye myght haue sayd y
t
 ye wolde haue takē an hole yere of respyte by the popes leue. But for to suffre what deth ye coude ordeyn / we shal not spare for to tell you holly all y
•
 popes message & his wyll / that we were charged with.






¶ How Pandulf delyuered a clerke that had falsed and coūterfeyted the kynges money before the kynge hymselfe.


ANd anone the kyng cōmaunded the sheriues & baylyes of North hamton that were in y
e
 kynges presence that they sholde brynge forth all the pry¦soners / that they myght be done to deth before Pandulf / bycause y
e
 kyng wende that they wolde haue gaynsayd theyr dedes for cause of dethe all thynge that he had spoken afore. Whan y
e
 prysoners were comen before the kynge / the kyng cōmaunded some to be hanged / & some to be drawen / & some to drawe out theyr eyen of theyr heed. And amōge all other there was a clerke that had falsed the kynges money. And the kyng cōmaun∣ded that he sholde be hanged & drawen. And whan Pandulf herde this cōmaū∣dement of the kynge / he sterte hym vp ryght quyckly / and anone asked a boke and a candell / and wold haue cursed the kynge / and all them that wold set vpon the clerke ony hande. And Paudulf him self went for to seke a crosse. And y
e
 kyng folowed hym / & delyuered hym y
e
 clerke by y
e
 hande / that he sholde do with hym what he wolde. And thus was y
e

And than toke the kynge the crowne of his heed & set hȳ on his knees and these wordes he sayd in herynge of all the grete lordes of englonde. Here I resygne vp the crowne & the realme of englonde in to the handes of pope Inno cent the thyrde / & put me hooly in to his mercy & in his ordinaūce. Pandulf than receyued y

¶ How the clerkes that were outlawed of Englonde came agayn / & how kynge Iohn was assoyled.


WHan this chartre was made & ensealed / the kynge receyued a∣gayne his crowne of Pandulfs hande / & sente anone vnto the archebys∣shop Stephen / & to all his other clerkes and lewd men that he had exyled out of this londe / that they sholde come agayn in to Englonde & haue agayn theyr lon∣des & also theyr rentes / & that he wolde make restytucyon of the goodes that he had taken of theyrs agaynst theyr wyll The kyng hymselfe than & Pandulf / & the erles & barons went to wynchestre agaynst y

 archebysshop Stephen. And whan he was comen the kynge wente agaynst hym / & fell downe to his feet / & thus to hym sayd. Fayre syr ye be wel∣come / & I crye you mercy bycause that I haue trespaced agaynst you. The ar∣chebysshop toke hȳ vp tho in his armes & kyssed hym curteysly oftētymes / & af∣ter ladde hym to the dore of saynt Swy¦thynes chirche by the hande / & assoyled hym of y
•
 sentence / and hym recōcyled to god & to holy chirche. And that was on saynt Margaretes daye. And the arche bysshop anone went for to synge masse. And y
•
 kyng offred at the masse a marke of golde. And whan y
•
 masse was done / all they went to receyue al theyr londes without ony maner gaynsayenge. And that daye they made all myrth and ioye ynough. But yet was not y
•
 enterdytyn¦ge releaced / bycause y
•
 pope had set that the enterdytynge sholde not be done tyll the kyng had made full restitucyon of y
•



goodes that he had take of holy chirche And y
•
 hymselfe sholde do homage to the pope by a tertayne legate that he sholde sende into englonde. And thā toke Pan∣dulf his leue of y
•
 kynge & the archebys∣shop / & went agayne to Rome. And the archebysshop anone let come before him prelates of holy chirche at Redynge for to treate & coūseyle how moche & what they sholde aske of y
•
 kynge for to make restytucyon of y
•
 goodes y
•
 he had taken of them. And they ordeyned & sayd / that the kyng sholde gyue to y
•
 archebysshop thre thousande marke for the wronge y
•
 the kynge had done vnto hym. And also by porcions to other clerkes .xv. M. mar¦ke. ¶ And this same tyme Nicolas bys∣shop of Tuscan cardynall penytencer of Rome came in to Englonde through the popes cōmaūdement / the .v. kalende of October / & came to London y

¶ How y
•
 enterdytynge was vndone in englonde / & of y
•
 debate y
•
 was bytwene kyng Iohn & the barons of the realme


WHan kynge Iohn had done his homage to y
•
 legate y
•
 shewed hȳ the popes lettre y
•
 he shold paye to Iulyan / and yelde agayne that was kynge Rychardes wyfe y
•
 thyrde parte of the londe of Englonde & of Irlonde y
•
 he had with holden syth that kyng Ry∣charde dyed. Whan kynge Iohn herde this / he was wonders wroth. For vtter¦ly y
•
 enterditynge myght not be vndone tyll that he had made gree & resticucyon to the foresayd Iulyan of that she asked The legate than went agayn to y
•
 pope after Chrystmasse. And the kynge than sent messengers outr see to Iulian that was kyng Rychard wyfe for to haue a relese of y
•
 she axed of hym. ¶ And so it befell y
•
 Iulyan dyed anone after 
ster. And in so moche the kyng was quyte of that thynge that she asked. But than at the feest of saynt Iohn that came nexte after through the popes cōmaūdemēt y
•
 enterdityng was fyrst released through out all Englonde the .vij. daye of Iuly. And .vij. yere was the londe enterdited. And on the morow men ronge and sayd masse through out all London / & so after through out all Englonde. ¶ And y
•
 next yere after there began a grete debate by¦twene kyng Iohn & the lordes of Eng∣londe / for bycause he wolde not graunte the lawes and holde / the whiche saynt Edwarde had ordeyned / & had ben v
ed and holden vnto that tyme that he had them brokē. For he wolde holde no lawe but dyd all thynge that hym lyked and dysheryted many men without consent of lordes & peres of the londe. And wold dysheryte y
•
 good erle Radulf of hestre for bycause that he vndertoke hȳ of his wyckednes / and for cause that he dyd so moche shame & vylany to god & to holy chirche. And also for he helde & haunred his owne broders wyfe / and lay also by maner other womē grete lordes dough∣ters / for he spared no woman that hym lyked for to haue. Wherfore all y
•
 fordes of the londe were wroth / & toke the cyte of London. To cease this debate the ar∣chebysshop & lordes of the londe assem∣bled before the feest of saynt Iohn bap∣tyst in a medow besyde y
•
 towne of Sta∣nes / that is called Romney mede. And the kynge made them there a chartre of fraunchyse / suche as they wolde aske / and in suche maner they were accorded And that accordement lasted not longe. For the kynge hymselfe soone after dyd agaynst the poynces of y
•
 same chartre


that he had made. Wherfore the moost part of the lordes of the londe assembled them / & began to warre vyon hȳ agayn and brent his townes & robbed his folke and dyd all thesorowe that they myght and made themselfe as stronge as they myght with all theyr power / & thought to dryue hym out of Englonde / & make Lowys y
•
 kynges sone of Fraūce kynge of Englonde. And than kyng Iohn sent ouer see / and ordeyned so moche people or normans & of pyecardes and of flem∣mynges / soo that the londe myght not susteyne them but with moche sorowe. And amonge all this people there was a man of Normandye that was called Faukes of Brent / & this Norman & his cōpany spared neyther chirche ne hous of religyon but they brent and robbed it & bare awaye all that they myght take so that y
•
 londe was all destroyed / what on one syde & what on another. The ba¦rons and lordes of Englonde ordeyned amonge them the best spekers and wy∣sest men / and sent them ouer the see vn∣to kynge Philyp of Fraūce / and prayed hym y
•
 he wolde sende Lowys his sone in to Englonde to be kynge of Englonde and to receyue the crowne.






¶ How Lowys y
•
 kynges sone of fraūce came in to Englonde w
t
 a stronge power of people to be kynge of Englonde.


WHan kyng Philip of Fraūce herd these tydynges / he made certayn aliaunce bytwene them by theyr comyn eleccyon y
•
 Lowys kynge Philyps sone of Fraūce shold go with them in to Eng londe and dryue out kynge Iohn of the londe. And all that were in the presence of Lowys made vnto him homage and became his men. And the barons of eng londe helde them styll at London / and abode Lowys y
•
 kynges sone of fraūce. And this was the nexte batardaye br∣fore the Astention of our lorde y
•
 Lowys came into Englonde with a stronge po∣wer. And that tyme kynge Iohn had taken all the castelles of Englonde in to alyens handes. And than came Lowys and besyeged 
ochesters castell / & toke it with streugthe. And the thursdaye in whytson weke let hange all the alyens that were therin. And the thursdaye af¦ter he came to London / & there he was receyued with moche honour of the lor∣des that abode hym there / & all to hym made homage. And afterwarde on the tewesdaye nexte after Trynite sondaye he toke the castell of Reigate / and on the morowe after the castell of Gylforde / & the frydaye next after the castell of Far∣neham. And the mondaye nexte after the cyte of wynchestre vnto hym was yolden. And on the morowe after saynt Iohans daye the manoyre of woluesey to hym was yolden. And the tewesdaye after the vtas of saynt Peter and saynt Paule they toke the castell of Odiham. And the mondaye after saynt Marga∣retes daye / he ordeyned hym towarde Bawmore for to syege the castell / and there he dwelled .xv. dayes and myght not gete the castell / and than wente he thens and came to London / & the toure to hym was yolden.






¶ How the pope sent in to Englonde a legate that was called Swalo / and of the deth of kynge Iohn.


ANd in y

 same tyme y

 pope sente in to englōde a legate y
•
 was cal¦led Swalo / & he was preest Cardynall of Rome for to mayntayn kynge Iohns cause agaynst the barons of Englonde. But the barons had so huge party and helpe through Lowys y
•
 kynges sone of Fraūce that kyng Iohn wyst not whe∣der


to turne ne go. And so it befell that he wolde haue gone to Nycholl / & as he went thyderwarde he came by y
e
 abbey of Swynestede / & there he abode two dayes. And as he sate at meet he asked a monke of the hous how moche a lofe was worth y
t
 was set before hym vpon the table. And the monke sayd that the lofe was worth but an halfpeny. O said the kyng tho / here is grete chepe of bre∣de. Now quod the kynge / & I may lyue suche a lofe shall be worth .xx. shyllȳges or halfe a yere be gone. And whā he had sayd these wordes / moche he thought & oft he syghed / & toke and ete of the breed and sayd / by god y
e
 wordes that I haue spoken it shall be soth. The monke that stode before y
e
 kynge was for these wor∣des full sory in his herte / & thought ra∣ther he wolde hymselfe suffre deth / and thought how he myght ordeyn therfore some maner remedy. And the monke a∣none went to his abbot / & was shryuen of hym / and tolde the abbot all that the kynge had sayd / and prayed his abbot for to assoyle hym / for he wold gyue the kynge suche a drynke that all Englonde sholde be glad therof and ioyfull. Than went the monke in to a gardeyn & foūde a grete tode therin / and toke her vp and put her in a cuppe / and prycked the tode through with a broche many tymes tyl that the venym came out on euery syde in the cuppe / and than toke the cuppe & fylled it with good ale / & brought it be∣fore the kynge and knelynge sayd. Syr quod he wassayle / for neuer the dayes of your lyf dranke ye of so good a cuppe. Begyn monke quod the kynge. And the monke dranke a grete draught / & after toke the kynge the cuppe / and the kyng also dranke a grete draught & set downe the cup. The monke anone ryght went in to the farmery and there dyed anone / on whose soule god haue mercy Amen. And .v. monkes synge for his soule spe∣cyally / and shall whyles the abbey stan¦deth. The kyng arose vp anone full euyl at ease / and commaūded to remeue the table / and asked after the monke. And men tolde hym that he was deed / and that his wombe was broken in sonder. Whan the kynge herde this / he cōmaū∣ded to trusse / but it was all for nought / for his bely began to swell of the drynke that he had dronken / and within two dayes he dyed / on y
e
 morowe after saynt Lukes daye. And this kynge Iohn had many fayre chyldren of his body bego∣ten / that is to saye / Henry his sone that was kynge after his fader / & Rycharde that was erle of Cornewayle / & Isabel that was empresse of Rome / & Elenour that was quene of Scotlonde. And this kynge Iohn whan he had regned .xvij. yere and .v. monethes and .v. dayes he dyed in the castell of Newarke / and his body was buryed at Worcetter.






¶ Anno domini. M .CC.

¶ Prophecy of Merlyn of kynge Hen∣ry the fyrst expowned that was kynge Iohns sone.


ANd of this Hēry {pro}phecyed Mer¦lyn & sayd that a 
a
be sholde come out of Wynchestre in y
•
 yere of our lord. M .CC. and .xvj. with true lyppes & holynes wryten in his herte. And he sayd soth / for y
•
 good Henry y
•
 kyng was borne ī wynchestre in y
•
 yere aboue sayd & he spake good wordes & swete / & was an holy man & of good conscyence. And Merlyn sayd y
•
 this Henry sholde make the fayrest place of y
•
 worlde / y
•
 in his ty∣me shold not be fully ended. And he sayd soth. For he made y
•
 newe werke of y
•
 ab∣bey of saȳt Peters chirche at Westmyn¦ster / y
•
 is fayrer of syght than ony other place y
•
 ony man knoweth through out all chrystendom. But kyng Henry dyed or y
•
 werke was fully at an ende / & that was grete harme. And yet said Merlyn that this lambe shold haue peas y
•
 most parte of his regne. And he said soch. For he was neuer noyed through warre ne dyseased in no maner wyse / tyll a lytell before his deth. And Merlyn said in his prophecy more / y
•
 in the ende of y
•
 regne of y
•
 foresayd lambe / a wolfe of a straūge lōde sholde do hȳ moche harme through his war / & y
•
 he shold at y
•
 last be maister through helpe of a reed fore / that sholde


come out of the Northwest & 
shold
 outr come hym / & that he sholde dryue hym out of the water. And that {pro}phecy full well was knowen. For within a lytell tyme or the kynge dyed / Symonde of Mountforde erle of Leycestre that was borne in Fraunce began stronge warre agaynst hym / through whiche doynge many a good bacheler was destroyed. And whan kynge Henry had y
•
 vyctory at Eusham & Symon y
•
 erle was slayne through helpe of Gylberte of Clare erle of Glocestre / that was in kepyng of the foresayd Symon / through ordynaunce of kynge Henry / whiche went agayne to the kynge with moche power. Wher¦fore the soresayd Symō was destroyed and that was grete harme to y
•
 comyns of Englonde that so noble a man was slayne for the trouth / & dyed in charite & for the comyn profyte of the same folke. And therfore almyghty god for hȳ hath sythen shewed many a fayre myracle to dyuers men & women seke for his loue. ¶ And Merlyn also tolde & sayd in his prophecy / that after that tyme y
•
 lambe sholde lyue no whyle / and than his seed sholde be in straūge londe without ony pasture. And he sayd sothe. For kynge Henry lyued no whyle after whan that Symon Moūtford was deed / but dyed anone after hym. And in y
•
 meane tyme syr Edwarde his sone that was the best kynge of y
•
 worlde of honour was than in y

 holy londe / & gate there Acres. And in y
•
 coūtree he begate on dame Elenour his wyfe Ihone of Acres his doughter that afterwarde was countesse of Glo∣cestre. And made suche a vyage in y
•
 ho∣ly londe that all the worlde spake of his knyghthode / & euery man dradde hym hye and lowe through out all chrysten∣dome / as the story of hym telleth / as af∣terward ye shall here more openly. And from the tyme y

 kynge Henry dyed / tyll that syr G

¶ How Ydeyne that was Lewelyns doughter of Wales / and Aymer that was the erles broder of Mountforde were taken on the see.



THe fyrst yere after that kyng Ed¦warde was crowned / Lewlyn prynce of Wales sent in to Fraūce to the erle Mountford / that through coūseyle of his frendes the erle sholde wedde his doughter. And the erle thā auysed hym vpon this thynge / & sent vnto Lewlyn and sayd that he wolde sende after his doughter. And so he sent Aymer his bro¦der after the damoysell. And Lewlyn a∣rayed shyppes for his doughter & for syr Aymer / & for her fayre company y
•
 
shold
 go with her. And this Lewlyn did grete wronge / for it was a couenaunt that he sholde gyue his doughter to no maner man without coūseyle & cōsent of kynge Edwarde. And so it befell that a Bur∣geys of Brystowe came in the see laden with wyne / & mette them / & toke them with myght and power. And anone the Burgeys sent them to the kyng. Whan Lewlyn herde these tydynges he was wonders wroth & also sorowfull / & begā to warre vpon kynge Edward / and dyd moche harme to Englysshe men / & bette downe the kynges castels / & began fast for to destroye kyng Edwardes londes. And whan the tydynges came vnto the kynge of this thynge / he went in to Wa¦les / & so moche he dyd through goddes grace and his grete power that he droue Lewlin to grete myschefe / that he fledde all maner strength & came & yelded hym vnto kynge Edward / & gaue hym .l. M. marke of syluer to haue peas / & toke the damoysell & all his herytage / & made an obly gacyon to kyng Edward to come to his parlyament two tymes in the yere. ¶ And in the seconde yere after y

 kynge Edward was crowned / he helde a gene∣rall parlyamēt at Westmynster / & there he made the statutes for defaute of lawe by the comyn assent of all his baronage. And at eester nexte after the kynge sent by his lettre vnto Lewlyn prynce of Wa¦les that he 
shold
 come to his parlyamēt for his londe / & for his holding of Wales as the strength of the lettre oblygatory wytnessed. Than Lewlyn had scorne & despyte of y
•
 kynges cōmaūdement. And for pure wrath agayn begā warre vpon kynge Edward / & destroyed his londes. And whan kyng Edward herde of these tydȳges / he waxed wonders wroth vn¦to Lewlyn / & in haste assembled a grete power of people & went towarde Wales and warred so vpon Lewlyn the prynce tyll y
•
 he brought hym in moche sorow & dysease. And Lewlyn sawe that his de∣fence myght not auayle hym / and came agayn & yelded hym to y

 was Lewlins broder y

 kyng Edward / & was a fell man and a subtyll / & enuyous / & also ferre castynge and moche treason thought / & euermore made good semblaunt / & semed so 
 y
•
 no man myght perceyue his falsnes.






¶ How Lewlyn through 
gg
nge of his broder Dauid warred agayn vpon kynge Edwarde.


IT was not longe tyme that tyme that kynge Edward gaue to Da∣uid Lewlyns broder the lordship of 
ro∣desham / and made hym knyght. And so moche honour dyd he neuer after to no man of Wales bycause of hym. ¶ Kyng Edward helde his parlyament at Lon∣don whan he had done in Wales al that he wolde / & chaūged his money y
•
 was foule kyt & roūded / wherfore the people cōplayned sore / so y
•
 the king let enquyre


of y
e
 trespassours. And .ccc. were atteyn∣ted of suche maner of falsnes / wherfore some were hanged / and some drawen & hanged. And afterward the kyng ordey ned / that y
e
 sterling halfpeny & ferthyng sholde go through out all his londe. And cōmaūded y
t
 no man fro that daye after∣warde gaue ne 
eoffed hous of religyon with londe or tenemēt / without specyall leue of y
e
 kynge / & he y
t
 dyd / sholde be pu∣nysshed at the kynges wyll / & the gyfte sholde be for nought. ¶ And it was not longe after that Lewlyn prynce of Wa∣les through y
e
 entycement of Dauid his broder / and by bothe theyr consent they thought to dysheryte kynge Edward in as moche as they myght / so y
t
 through them bothe y
e
 kynges peas was broken And whan kyng Edward herde of this anone he sent his barōs in to Northum berlonde & the surreys also / y
t
 they shold go & take theyr vsage vpon y
e
 traytours Lewlyn & Dauyd / & wonders harde it was for to warre than. For it is wynter in Wales / whan in other coūtrees it is somer. And Lewlyn let ordeyne & well aray & vitayle his good castel of Swan∣don / and therin was an huge nombre of people & plente of vitayles / so that kyng Edward wyst not where to entre. And whan y
e
 kynges men it perceyued / & al∣so y
e
 strength of Wales / they let come in to y
e
 see barges & botes & grete plankes as many as they might ordeyne & haue for to go to the foresayd castell of Swan∣don w
t
 men on fote & also on hors. But y
e
 Walshmen had so moche people & were so stronge / y
t
 they droue y
e
 Englysshmen backe / so y
t
 there was so moche prees of people at the turnynge agayn / that the charge & the burden of men made y
e
 bar∣ges & botes to synke / & there was drow∣ned many a good knyght / y
t
 is to say / syr Roger Clifford / syr William of Lindsey that was syr Iohns sone fitz Robert / & syr Rychard Tanny / & an huge nombre of other / & all was through theyr owne foly / for yf they had had good spies they had not ben harmed. Whan kynge Ed∣ward herde tell that his people were so drowned / he made sorowe ynough. But than came syr Iohn of Vessye from the kynge of Aragon / & brought with hym moch people of bachelers & of Gascoyns & were soudyours & dwellynge w
t
 Iohn of Vessye / & of hym receyued wages / & of hym were holden / & were noble men for to fyght / and brent many townes / & slewe all y
e
 walshmen that they myght take. And all those w
t
 strength & myght made assaute vnto the castell of Swan∣don / & gate the castell. And whā Dauid herde of these tydynges / he ordeyned hȳ to flyght. Whā Lewlyn y
e
 prynce knewe that his broder was fledde / thā was he sore abasshed / for he had no power his warre to maynteyn. And so Lewlyn be∣gan to flee / & wende well to haue scaped But in a mornyng syr Roger Mortimer mette w
t
 hym onely with .x. knightes / & set hym roūde aboute / & to hym went & smote of his heed / & presented it to kyng Edward. And in this maner Lewlyn y
e
 prynce of Wales was taken / & his heed smytten of / & also all his heyres dyshe∣ryted for euermore / through ryghtfull dome of all the lordes of the realme.






¶ How Dauid y
t
 was Lewlyns broder prynce of Wales was put to deth.


DAuid y
e
 prynces broder of Wales through pride wende to haue bē prynce of Wales after his broders deth / And vpō this he sent after walshmen to his patlyament at Dinbigh / & folysshly made Wales to aryse agaynst y
e
 kyng / & began to meue warre agaynst kyng Ed¦ward / & dyd all y
e
 sorowe & dysease that he myght by his power. Whan kynge


Edward herde of this thynge / he ordey ned men to pursue vpon hym. And Da∣uid fyer
y hym defended / tyll y
t
 he came to y
e
 towne of saynt Morite / & there was Dauid taken as he fledde / & ladde to the kynge. And the kyng cōmaūded that he shold be hanged & drawen / and smyte of his heed / & quarter hȳ / & sende his heed to London / & the foure quarters to the foure chefe townes of Wales / for they sholde take ensample therof & be ware. And afterward kynge Edward let crye his peas though out al wales / & seased all y
e
 londe into his handes / & all y
e
 grete lordes that were lefte alyue came to do feaute & homage to kynge Edward / as to theyr kynde lorde. And than let kynge Edward amende the lawes of Wales y
t
 were defectyue. And after he sent to al y
e
 lordes of Wales by his lettres patentes y
t
 they sholde come all to his parlyamēt. And whan they were comen the kynge sayd to them full curteysly. Lordes ye be welcome / & me behoueth your coūseyle & your helpe for to go in to Gascoyn / for to amende y
e
 trespace that to me was done whan I was there / & for to entreate of peas bytwene y
e
 kynge of Aragon & the prȳce of Morrey. And all y
e
 kynges liege men erles & barons consented & graūted therto. And than kynge Edwarde made hym redy & went in to Gascoyn / & let a∣mende all y
e
 trespaces y
t
 was done hȳ in Gascoyn. And of y
e
 debate that was by∣twene y
e
 kyng of Aragon & the prynce of Morrey he cessed & accorded them. And whyle kynge Edward & quene Elenore his wyfe were in Gascoyn / the good erle of Cornewayle was made wardeyn of Englonde tyll that kyng Edward came agayn. And thā enquyred he of his tray tours y
t
 coniected falsnes agaynst hym. And eche of thē all receyued theyr dome after that they had deserued. But in the meane tyme whyle that kyng Edward was beyonde y
t
 see to do them for to ma∣ke amendes y
t
 had trespaced agaynst hȳ there was a fals traytour y
t
 was called 
isap Meridoc began to make warre a∣gaynst kynge Edward / & that was for cause of syr Payne Tiptot y
e
 wrongfully greued & diseased y
e
 foresayd Bisap Me∣ridoc. And whan kynge Edward herde all this / he sente by his lettres to Bisap Meridoc that he sholde make no warre but that he sholde be in peas for his loue & whan he came agayne in to Englonde he wolde vndertake y
e
 quarell & amende all that was mysdone. This foresayd Risap Meridoc despysed the kynges cō∣maundement / & spared not to do all the sorowe that he myght to y
e
 kynges men of Englond. But anone after he was ta¦ken & ladde to yorke / and there he was drawen & hanged for his felony.






¶ Of the redressyng that king Edward made of his Iustices and of his clerkes that they had done for theyr falsnes / and how he droue y
e
 Iewes out of Englonde for theyr vsury and mysbyieue.


WHan kynge Edward had dwelled thre yere in Gascoyn / a desyre ca∣me to hȳ for to go in to Englonde agayn And whan he was comen agayn there were so many cōplayntes made to hym of his Iustices & of his clerkes that had done so many wronges & falsnes / that wonder it was to here. For whiche fals∣nes syr Thomas weylonde the kynges Iustyce forswore Englonde at y
e
 Toure of Londō / for falsnes that men put vpon hym / wherof he was atteynt & proued fals. And anone after whan the kynge had done his wyll of the Iustices than let he enquyre & espye how the Iewes deceyued & begyled his people through theyr synne of falsnes & of vsury / and let ordeyn a preuy parliament amonge his


lordes. And they ordeyned amōge them that all y
e
 Iewes shold voyde out of Eng lōde for theyr misbyleue & also for theyr false vsury that they dyd vnto chrysten men. And for to spede & make an ende of this thynge / all the comynalte of Eng∣londe gaue vnto the kynge the .xv. peny of al theyr goodes mouable. And so were the iewes dryuen out of Englonde. And than went y
e
 iewes in to Fraūce / & there they dwelled through leue of kyng Phi¦lyp that than was kynge of Fraūce.






¶ How kynge Edwarde was seased in all y
e
 londe of Scotlonde / through cōsent and graūte of all y
e
 lordes of Scotlonde.


IT was not longe after y
e
 Alexan∣der kyng of Scotlonde was deed and Dauid the erle of Huntingdon that was the kynges broder of Scotlond as∣ked & claymed y
e
 kingdom of Scotlonde after that his broder was deed / bycause that he was rightfull heyre. But many grete lordes sayd naye / wherfore grete debate arose bytwene them & theyr fren des / for as moche as they wolde not con sent to his crownacyon. And the meane tyme the foresayd Dauid dyed. And so it befell y
t
 the sayd Dauid had thre dough ters that worthely were maryed. The fyrst doughter was maryed to Bayloll / the seconde to Brus / & the thyrde to Ha∣stynges. The foresayd Bayloll & Brus chalenged y
e
 londe of Scotlonde / & grete debate & stryfe arose bytwene them thre bycause eche of them wolde haue ben kyng. And whan y
e
 lordes of Scotlonde sawe y
e
 debate bytwene them / they came to kyng Edward of Englonde / & seased hym in all y
e
 londe of Scotlonde as chefe lord. And whan the kyng was seased of the foresayd lordes of Scotlonde / y
e
 fore∣sayd Bayloll / Brus / & Hastynges came to the kynges courte / & asked of y
e
 kynge whiche of them sholde be kyng of Scot∣londe. And kyng Edward that was full gentyll & true / let enquyre by the crony∣cles of Scotlonde / & of the gretest lordes of Scotlonde / whiche of them was of y
e
 eldest blode. And it was foūde y
t
 Bayloll was the eldest / & that the kyng of Scot∣londe shold holde of y
e
 kyng of Englonde and do hym feaute & homage. And after this was done Bayloll went in to Scot¦londe / and there was crowned kynge of Scotlond. And y
e
 same tyme was vpon the see grete warre bytwene y
e
 englyssh men & the Normans. But vpon a tyme the Normās arryued at Douer / & there they martyred an holy man y
t
 was cal∣led Thomas of Douer. And afterward were the Normans slayne / y
t
 there esca∣ped not one of them. ¶ And soone after kynge Edward sholde lese the duchy of Gascoyn through kyng Philip of Fraū∣ce / through his fals castyng of y
e
 Dou
e peres of the lond / wherfore syr Edmond that was kyng Edwardes broder gaue vp his homage vnto y
e
 kyng of Fraūce. ¶ And in y
t
 tyme y
e
 clerkes of Englonde graūted to kynge Edward halfe dele of holy chirche goodes / in helpynge to re∣couer his londe agayn in Gascoyn. And the kynge sent thyder a noble company of his bachelers. And hymselfe wolde haue gone to Portesinouth / but he was letted through one Maddok of Wales y
t
 had seased the castell of Swandon in to his handes / & for that cause y
e
 kyng tur∣ned to Wales at Chrystmasse. And by∣cause that the noble lordes of Englond y
t
 were sent in to Gascoyn had no cōfort of theyr lorde the kyng they were taken of syr Charles of Fraūce / that is to say / syr Iohn of Brytayne / syr Robert Typtot / syr Raufe Tanny / syr Hugh Bardulf / & syr Adam of Cretynge. And yet at y
e
 As∣cencyon was Maddok taken in Wales & another whiche was called Morgan / 


and they were sent to the toure of Lon∣don / and there they were byheded.






¶ How syr Iohn Bailoll kyng of Scot¦londe withsayd his homage.


ANd whā syr Iohn Bailoll kyng of Scotlonde vnderstode y

 kyng Edwarde was warred in Gascoyne (to whome y
e
 realme of Scotlonde was de∣lyuered) falsly than agaynst his othe w
t
∣sayd his homage through procuryng of his folke / & sent vnto the courte of Rome through a fals suggestion to be assoyled of the othe y
t
 he swore vnto the kynge of Englonde. And so he was by lettre em∣bulled. ¶ Than chose they of Scotlonde Douspers for to take from Edward his ryght. ¶ And in y
t
 tyme came two car∣dynals from Rome fro y
e
 pope Celestyne to treate of accorde bytwene the kyng of Fraūce & the kyng of Englonde. And as those cardynals spake of accorde / Tho∣mas Turbeluyl was taken at Lyons & made feaute & homage to the warden of Parys / & to hym put his two sones in hostage / & thought to go in to Englonde for to espye the coūtre / & tell them whan he came in to Englonde y
t

t
 all englysshmen & walshmen sholde be aboute y
e
 kyng of Fraūce. And this thynge to bryng to an ende he swore / & vpon this couenaūt de∣des were made bytwene them / & that he sholde haue by yere a. M. poūdes worth of londe to brȳge this thynge to an ende. This fals traytour toke his leue & went thens & came in to Englōde vnto y
e
 kyng & sayd y
t
 he was broken out of pryson / & that he had put hȳ in suche peryl for his loue / wherfore y
e
 kynge coude hȳ moche thanke / & full glad was of his comynge And the fals traytour fro y
t
 daye espyed all the doynge of y
e
 kynge & also his coū∣seyle / for the kynge loued hym well / and was w
t
 hym full preuy. But a clerke of Englonde y
t
 was in the kynges hous of Fraūce herde of this treason & falsnes / & wrote to an other clerke that than was dwellyng w
t
 kyng Edward of Englonde all how Thomas Turbeluyll had done his fals conife
tynge / & all the coūseyle of Englonde was wryten for to haue sent vnto y
e
 king of Fraūce. And through the foresayd lettre that y
e
 clerke had sent fro Fraūce / it was foūde vpon hym wher fore he was / ladde to London and there hāged and drawen for his treason. And his two sones that he had put in Fraū

e
 reed hall with a quarell as y

 foresayd Rycharde dyd of his helme & cōmaūded them for to yelde them & put them in the kynges grace / & the Scottes wolde not / wherfore y
e
 hall was brent & cast downe / & all those that were therin were brent. And kyng Ed∣ward lost no moo men at that vyage of symple estate but .xxvij. Englysshmen. And the wardeyn of the castell gaue vp the keys of the castell w

e
 castell / & sent hym worde but yf he wolde remeue the syege of the englysshmen / that they wolde yelde the castell to the englysshmen. The messen∣ger than came vnto syr Iohn Bailoll (y
e
 than was kynge of Scotlonde) where as he was with his hoost / and the mes∣senger tolde hym all the case. And than syr Iohn Bayloll toke his hoost & came on the morowe erly towarde the castell. And syr Rychard Sywarde sawe hym come that was mayster of the coūseyle and keper of y
e
 castell / and sayd vnto the Englysshemen. O quod he / now I se a fayre company and well apparayled / I wyll goo agaynst them and mete with them / and assayle them. And syr Hugh Spenser sawe the falsnes of hym & the treason / and sayd to hym. O traytour ta¦ken and proued / your falsnes shall not auayle you. And syr Hugh Spenser cō∣maūded anone for to bynde hym / and in all haste went agaynst theyr enemyes / and slewe of the Scottes the nombre of xxij. M. For the Scottes had that tyme no man with them of honour / saue syr Patryk Graham that manly fought & longe / & at the last he was slayne. And than sayd the englysshmen in reprefe of the Scottes. These scaterand Scottes holde I for sottes of wrenches vnware. Erly in a mornynge in an euyll tymyng went ye fro Dunbare. ¶ Whan those y
t

¶ How kynge Edward of his grete grace delyuered agayne the Scottes out of pryson that were chefetaynes of the londe / and they drewe them to the Frensshmen through the coūseyle of Wyllyam Waleys.



THan whan kynge Edward had made an ende of the warre & ta∣ken the chefetaynes of Scotlond. Than came syr Iohn Bayloll w
t
 other & yelded them vnto kyng Edward & put them in his grace / & were ladde to London. And whā kyng Edward was comen thyder they were brought before hȳ / & y
e
 kynge asked of them how they wolde make a∣mendes of the trespace & losse y
t
 they had done him / & they put them in his mercy Lordes sayd the kyng / I wyll not your londes ne your goodes / but I wyll y
t
 ye make to me an othe vpō goddes body to be true to me / & neuer after this tyme a∣gaynst me bere armes. And they all con¦sented to the kynges wyll / & swore vpon goddes body / y
t
 is to say / syr Iohn of Co¦myn / y
e
 erle of Strathorne / y
e
 erle of Ca∣
yk / & also .iiij. bisshops vndertoke for al the clergy / & so y
e
 kynge delyuered them and gaue them safeconduytes to go in to theyr owne coūtree. And it was not lōge afterwarde but that they arose agaynst kyng Edward / bycause that they wyst well that kynge Edwardes folke were taken in Gascoyn / as before is sayd / but syr Iohan Bayloll kynge of Scotlonde wyst well that his londe sholde haue so∣rowe ynough & shame for theyr falsnes / and in haste went hym ouer y
e
 see to his owne londes / and there helde hym / and neuer came agayne. Wherfore y
e
 Scot∣tes chose vnto theyr kyng Willyam Wa¦leys a rybaud and an harlot / comen vp of nought / & to englysshmen dyd moche harme. ¶ And kyng Edward thought how he myght best delyuer his people that were taken in Gascoyne / & in haste went hym ouer the see in to Flaundres for to warre vpon the kyng of Fraunce. And the erle of Flaūdres receyued hym with moche honour / & graūted hym all his londes at his owne wyl. And whan the kyng of Fraūce herde tell y
t
 the kyng of Englond was arryued in Flaūdres & came w
t
 an huge power to destroye hym he prayed hȳ of trewse for two yere / so y
e
 englysshe marchaūtes and also frensshe myght safely go & come on bothe sydes. Kynge Edwarde graūted it / so y
t
 he had his men out of prison y
t
 were in Gascoyn And y
e
 kyng of Fraūce graūted anone / & so they were delyuered. ¶ In the same tyme the Scottes sent by the bysshop of saynt Andrewes in to Fraūce to y
e
 kyng & to syr Charles his broder y
t
 syr Char∣les shold come w
t
 his power and they of Scotlond wolde come w
t
 theyr power & so they sholde go in to Englonde y
e
 lond
 to destroye from Scotlond vnto 
en

e
 frenssh men. But of y
t
 thȳge they had no maner graūte. Yet neuerthelesse y

e
 Ascencyon tyde / & all that he foūde he set a fyre & brent. But y

e
 londe he dwelled as longe as hym lyked & there was none enemy that durst him abyde. And soone after y

tegne in Englonde / & sayd y
t
 he sholde be medled with mercy & also w
t
 strengthe & sternes / that shold kepe Englonde from colde & hete. And that he sholde open his mouth toward Wales / & that he sholde set his fote in Wyke / & that he shold close with walles y
t
 shold do moche harme to his sede. And he sayd sothe / for the good kynge Edward was medled w
t
 mercy & with fyersnes / with mercy agaynst his enemyes of Wales / & after of Scotlōde with fyersnes whā he put them to deth for theyr falsnes & traytory / as they had deserued it. And well kepte he Englond from colde & hete / syth he kepte it frō all maner of enemyes that came vpon him to do hym ony wronge. And well he ope¦ned his mouth towarde Wales / & made it quake through y
e
 hidour of his mouth whan he conquered it through dynt of swerde. For y
e
 prynce Lewlyn & Dauyd his broder / Rys & Morgan were put to deth through theyr falsnes & theyr foly. And he set his fote in wike / & conquered Barwyke / at the whiche conquest were slayn .xxv. M. and. vij .C. out take them that were brent in the reed hall. And the walles that he let make shall be noyous vnto his sede / as men shall here after se in the lyfe of syr Edward of Carnaruan his sone. And yet sayd Merlyn that he sholde make ryuers ren in blode & with brayn / & that semed well in his warres where as he had the maystry. And yet Merlin sayd y
t
 there shold come a people out of the north west durynge the regne of the foresayd dragon / y
t
 sholde be ladde by an yll greyhoūde / y
t
 the dragon sholde crowne kyng / that afterward sholde flee ouer y
e
 see for drede of y
e
 dragon without comynge agayn / & y
t
 was proued by syr Iohn Bayloll y
e
 kyng Edward made to be kynge of Scotlonde / that falsly arose agaynst him / & after he fled to his owne londes of Fraūce / & neuer came agayne in to Scotlonde for drede of kynge Ed∣ward. And yet sayd Meriyn the people that sholde lede the foresayd greyhoūde shold be faderles vnto a certayn tyme / & he sayd sothe / for y
e
 people of Scotlonde gretely were dyseased / syth y
t
 syr Iohn Bayloll theyr kung was fledde. And yet layd Merlin y
t
 the sonne shold become in his tyme as reed as blode / in tokenynge of grete mortalite of people / & that was well knowē whan y
e
 scottes were 
ay
. And Merlyn sayd y
t
 same dragon sholde nourysshe a foxe that sholde meue grete warre agaynst hym y
t
 shold in his tyme be ended / & that semed well by Robert y
e
 Brus that kyng Edward noursshed in his chambre / that sythen stale aware & meued grete warre agaynst hym wh
 the warre was not ended in his tyme. And afterward Merlyn tolde y
t
 this dra gon shold be holden y
e
 best body of all the worlde / & he sayd sothe for y
e
 good kyng Edward was y
e
 worthyest knyght of all y
e
 worlde in his tyme. And yet said mer lyn y
t
 the dragon sholde dye in y
e
 marche of an other londe / & y
t
 his londe sholde be longe w

out a good keper / & y
t
 men sholde wepe for his deth from y
e
 yle of Shepey vnto y
e
 yle of Mercill: wherfore alas shal be theyr songe amonge y
e
 
myn people faderles in y
e
 londe wasted. And y
e
 p
h
 cy was knowen ouer all full well. For y
e
 good king Edward dyed at Burgh vpō sandes / y
t
 is in the marche of Scotlonde wherfore y
e
 englysshmē were discōf

e
 song through out all Englonde for defaute of theyr good wardeyn / from y
e
 yle of Shepey vnto y
e
 yle of Mareyll y
e
 people made moche so∣rowe for good king Edwardes deth. For they wende y

 kyng Edward shold haue gone in to the holy lond / for y

 sentence sholde be pro∣nounced through out all Englonde. And whan y
e
 Scottes herde this / they 
wold
 not leue theyr malyce for the popes com¦maūdemēt / wherfore Robert the Brus Iames Douglas / & Thomas Randulf erle of Moref / & all those that w
t
 them co∣moned or holpe them in worde or dede were accursed in euery chirche through out all Englonde euery day at masse .iii. tymes / & no masse shold be songe in holy chirche through out all Scotlonde but yf y
e
 Scottes wolde make restitucyon of the harmes y
t
 they had made vnto holy chirche / wherfore many a good preest & holy men therfore were slayne through the realme of Scotlonde / bycause they wolde not synge masse agaynst y
e
 popes cōmaūdement & agaynst his wyll and to do and fulfyll the tyrauntes wyll.






¶ How syr Hugh Spensers sone was made the kynges chamberlayne / and of the batayle of Mitone.


ANd it was not longe afterward that y
e
 kynge ne ordeyued a par∣liament at yorke / & there was syr Hugh Spensers sone made chamberlain. And the meane tyme whyle the warre lasted


the kyng went agayn in to Scotlonde y
t
 it was wonder to wyte / & besyeged the towne of Barwyk / but y
e
 Scottes went ouer y
e
 water of Solewath y
t
 was thre myle frō y
e
 kynges hoost / & pryuely they stale away by nyght & came in to englōd & robbed & destroyed all y
t
 they myght / & spared no maner thȳge tyll y
t
 they came to yorke. And whan y
e
 englysshmen that were lefte at home herd these tydynges all tho y
t
 might trauayle as well mōkes preestes / freres / thanōs & seculers came & mette w
t
 the scottes at Miton vpswale the .xij. day of October. Alas y
e
 sorow / for the englisshe husbondmen that coude no thȳge of warre there were slayne & drow ned in an arme of y
e
 see. And y
e
 chefetay∣nes syr William of Melton archebisshop of yorke: & y
e
 abbot of selby w
t
 theyr stedes fled & came to yorke / & y
t
 was theyr owne foly y
t
 they had y
t
 mischaūce / for they pas sed y
e
 water of swale / & y
e
 scottes set a fyre the stackes of hey: & y
e
 smoke therof was so huge y
t
 the englysshmen myght not se the scottes. And whan y
e
 Englysshmen were gone ouer y
e
 water / than came the Scottes w
t
 theyr wynge in maner of a shelde & came towarde y
e
 englysshmen in araye / & the englysshmen fledde / for vn∣neth they had ony men of armes / for the kyng had them almoost lost at y
e
 syege of Barwyk / and the scottes hoblers went bytwene the brydge & the englysshmen. And whan y
e
 grete hoost them mette / the englysshmen fled bytwene y
e
 hoblers & y
e
 grete hoost / & the Englysshmen almoost were there slayn / & they y
t
 might go ouer the water were saued / but many were drowned. Alas for there were slayne ma¦ny men of relygyon / seculers / preestes & clerkes: & w
t
 moche sorow y
e
 archebisshop escaped: & therfore y
e
 Scottes called that batayle the whyte batayle.






¶ How kynge Edwarde dyd all maner thynge that syr Hugh Spenser wolde.


ANd whan kyng Edward herde these tydynges / he remeued his syege from Barwik & came agayn in to Englonde. But syr Hugh Spenser the sone that was y
e
 kynges chamberlayne kepte so the kynges chambre / y
t
 no man myght speke with y
e
 kynge. But he had made with hym a f
ette for to do all his nede / & y
t
 ouer mesure. And this Hugh bare hym so stoute / that all men had of hym scorne and despyte. And the kynge hymselfe wold not be gouerned ne ruled by no maner man but onely by his fader and by hym. And yf ony knyght of Eng∣londe had wodes / maners or lōdes / that they wolde coueyte / anone y
e
 kyng must gyue it them / or els the man that ought it sholde be falsly endyted of forfayte or felouy. And through suche doynge they disheryted many a bacheler / & so moche loude he gate that it was grete wonder. And whan y
e
 lordes of Englonde sawe y
e
 grete couetyse & the falsnes of syr Hugh Spenser the fader & syr Hugh the sone / they came to y
e
 gentyll erle of Lancastre and asked hym of coūseyle of the dysease that was in y
e
 realme through syr Hugh Spenser and his sone. And in haste by one assent they made a preuy assemble at Shyrburne in Elmede / and they made there an othe for to breke & dystrouble y
e
 doynge bytwene y
e
 king & syr Hugh spen ser & his sone vpō theyr power. And they wēt in to y
e
 marche of wales & destroyed the londe of the foresayd syr Hughes.






¶ How syr Hugh Spenser & his fader were exiled out of Englonde.


WHan kyng Edward sawe y
e
 grete harme & destruccyon that the ba∣rons of Englond dyd to syr Hugh Spen sers londe & to his sones in euery place y
t
 they came vpon / the king than through his coūseyle exiled syr Iohn Mombray / 


syr Roger Clifford / & syr Gosselin Dauil & many other lordes y
t
 were cōsentynge to them / wherfore the barons dyd than more harme than they dyd before. And whan y
e
 kyng sawe y
e
 the barons wolde not cease of theyr cruelte / the kyng was sore adrad lest they wold destroye hym & his realme for his mayntenaūce / but yf he assented to them / & so he sent for them by lettres y
t
 they sholde come to London to his parliament at a certayne daye as in his lettres were conteyned. And they came w
t
 thre batayles well armed at all poyntes / and euery batayle had cote ar∣mures of grene cloth / & therof the ryght quarter was yelowe w
t
 whyte bendes / wherfore that parliament was called y
e
 parlyament of the whyte bende. And in that company was syr Vmfrey of Bo∣houne erle of Herford / & syr Roger Clif∣ford / syr Iohn Mombray / syr Gosselyn Dauyll / syr Roger Mortimer of Wyg∣more / syr Henry of Trais / syr Iohn Gif fard / & syr Barthilme we of Badelsmore that was the kynges steward / that the kyng had sent to Shyrbur
ein Elmede to y
e
 erle of Lancastre / & to all that were with hym for to treate of accorde / y
t
 hym alyed to the barons / & came w
t
 that com∣pany. And syr Roger Dammorie / & syr Hugh Dandale y
e
 had spoused y
e
 kynges neces syster / & syr Gylbert of Clare erle of Glocestre y
t
 was slayne in Scotlonde as before is sayd. And those two lordes had than two partyes of the erledome of Glocestre / & syr Hugh Spenser the sone had y
e
 thyrde parte in his wyues halfe the thyrd syster / & those two lordes wēt to y
e
 barons w
t
 all theyr power agaynst syr Hugh theyr broder 
 lawe / & so there came with them syr Roger Clifford / syr Iohn Mombray / syr Gosselyn Dauyll / syr Roger Mortymer of Wygmore his neuew / syr Henry Trais / syr Iohn Gif∣fard / syr Barthylmewe of Badelsmore with all theyr company & many other y
•
 to them were consentyng. All the grete lordes came to Westmynster to the kyn∣ges parliament / & so they spake & dyd y
e
 bothe syr Hugh Spenser the fader & al∣so the sone were outlawed of Englonde for euermore. And so syr Hugh the fader went to Douer & made moche sorow / & fell downe vpon y
•
 groūde by y
e
 see banke acrosse with his armes / & sore wepyng sayd. Now fayre Englonde & good Eng londe to almyghty god I the betake / & thryes kyssed y
e
 groūde / & wende neuer to haue comen agayn / & wepyng cursed the tyme y
t
 euer he begate syr Hugh his sone / & sayd for hȳ he had lost all englōde & in presence of all gaue him his curse & went ouer the see to his londes. But 
 Hugh the sone wolde not go out of Eng∣londe / but helde hym on y
e
 see & he & his cōpany robbed two Dromondes besyde Sandwyche / & toke & bare awaye all y
e
 was in them / the value of .xl. M. poūde.






¶ How the kyng exiled y
e
 erle Thomas of Lancastre / & all that helde with hym and how Mortimer came & yelded hym to the kynge / and of the lordes.


IT was not longe after y
e
 the kyng ne made syr Hugh Spenser th
 
a der & syr Hugh the sone come agayne in to Englonde agaynst the lordes wyll of the realme. And soone after the kyng w
t
 a stronge power came and besyeged the castell of Ledes / & in the castell was the lady of Badelsmore bycause y
e
 she wold not graūte that castell to the quene I sa∣bell kyng Edwardes wyfe. But y
e
 prin∣cypall cause was bycause y
e
 syr Barthil∣mewe was agaynst the kyng & helde w
t
 the lordes of Englonde / & neuerthelesse the kynge by helpe and socour of men of London / and also of helpe of southeren men gate the castell maugre of them all


that were within / & toke with them all that they myght fynde. And whan the barons of Englonde herde these tydyn∣ges / syr Roger Mor
mer & many other lordes toke the towne of Burgworth w
t
 strength / wherfore the kyng was won∣ders wrothe / & let outlawe Thomas of Lācastre / & Vmfrey de Bohoune erle of Herford / & all those that were assentyng to the same quarell. And the kyng assem¦bled an huge hoost / & came agaynst the lordes of Englonde / wherfore the Mor∣timers put them in the kynges mercy & grace. And anone they were sente to the toure of London / & there kepte in prison. And whan y
e
 barons herde this thynge they came to Poūtfret castell / where as the erle Thomas soiourned / & told hym how that y
e
 Mortimers both had yelded them to y
e
 kyng / & put them i his grace.






¶ Of the syege of Tykhyll.


WHan Thomas erle of Lancastre herd this / he was wōders wroth and all y
t
 were of his company / & gretly they were discōforted / & ordeyned theyr power togyder / & besyeged the castell of Tykhyll. But those that were within manly defended them / that the barons coude not gete the castell. And whan the kynge herde y
t
 his castell was besyeged he swore by god & by his names / that y
e
 syege sholde be remeued / & assembled an huge power of people and went thyder∣ward to rescowe the castell / & his power encreased from daye to daye. Whan the erle of Lancastre / & the erle of Herford / & the barons of theyr cōpany herde of this thynge / they assembled all theyr power & went to Burton vpon Trent & kepte y
e
 brydge y
t
 the kyng sholde not passe ouer. But it befell so on the .x. daye of Marche in the yere of grace. M .ccc .xxj. the kyng & the Spensers / syr Aymer of Valaūce erle of Penbroke / & Ioh
erle of Arūdell and theyr power we
t ouer the water & discom
yted the erle Thomas & his com pany. And they fled to the castell of Tut∣bery / & from thens to Poūtfret. And in y
e
 vyage dyed syr Roget Danmore in the abbey of Tuthery. And that same tyme the erle Thomas had a traytour w
t
 him that was called Robert Holand a knight that y
e
 erle had brought vp of nought / & had nourysshed hym in his buttry / and had gyuen hym a. M. marke of londe by yere / & so moche the erle loued hym y
t
 he myght do in y
e
 erles courte all y
t
 hym ly∣ked w
t
 hye & lowe / & so craftely the thefe bare hym / y
t
 his lorde trusted hym more than ony man on lyue. And the erle had ordeyned hym by his lettres for to go in to the erledom of Lācastre to make men aryse to helpe hym in y
t
 viage / that is to saye .v .C. men of armes. But the false traytour came not there no maner men for to warne ne reyse to helpe his lorde. And whan the fals traytour herde tell y
t
 his lord was discōfited at Burton vpon Trent / as a fals traytour thefe stale a∣waye & robbed in Rauensdele his lordes men y
t
 came from the discōfyture / & toke of them hors & harneys & all y
t
 they had & slewe of them al that he myght take / & came & yelded hym to the kynge. Whan the good erle Thomas wyst y
t
 he was so betrayed / he was sore abasshed / & sayd to hȳselfe. O almighty god how myght Robert Holand fynde in his herte me to betraye / syth I loued hym so moche. O god well may now a man se by hȳ / y
t
 no man may deceyue an other rather than he that he trusteth moost vpon / he hath full euyll yelded me y
e
 goodnes & y
e
 wor∣shyp y
t
 I haue done to hym / & through my kyndnes haue auaūced him & made hym hye where that he was lowe / and he maketh me go from hygh vnto lowe / but yet shall he dye an euyll deth.








¶ Of the discomfyture of Burbrygge.


He good erle syr Thomas of Lan¦castre / Vmfrey de Bohoune erle of Herford / & the barons that were with them toke coūseyle bytwene them at the freres prechours in Poūfret / Thomas of Lancastre than thought vpon y
e
 trea∣son of Robert Holand / & sayd in reprefe. Alas Robert Holand hath me betrayed / aye is the reed of some euyll shreed. And by the comyn assent they 
shold
 go to the castell of Dunstanburgh / y
e
 whiche ap∣perteined to the erledom of Lancastre / & that they shold abyde there tyll that the kyng had forgyuen them his maletalēt. But whan the good erle Thomas herde this / he answered in this maner & sayd. Lordes said he / yf we go toward y
e
 north the northeren men wyll saye that we go towarde the Scottes / and so we shall be holden traytours / for cause of distaūce y
t
 is bytwene kyng Edward & Robert the Brus that made him kyng of Scotlond & therfore I saye as touchynge my selfe I wyll not go no ferther in to the north than to myn owne castell of Pountfret. And whan syr Roger Clifford herd this he arose vp anone in wrath & drewe his swerde on hygh / & swore by almyghty god & by his holy names / but yf that he wolde go w
t
 them / he shold there slee hȳ. The noble & gentyll erle Thomas was sore adrad & sayd. Fayre syrs I wyll go with you whether so euer ye me bydde. Than went they togider in to y
e
 north / & with them they had. vij .C. men of ar∣mes / & came to Burbrygge. Whan syr Andrewe of Herkela y
t
 was in the north coūtree through ordynaūce of the kynge for to kepe y
e
 coūtree of Scotlonde herde tell how y
e
 Thomas of Lancastre was dyscomfyted & his company at Burton vpon Trent / he ordeyned hym a stronge power / & syr Symond Ward also / that than was shyref of yorke / and me
te the barons at Burbrygge / and anone they brake y
e
 brydge that was made of tree. And whan y
e
 erle Thomas of Lancastre herde that syr Andrewe of Herk
a had brought w
t
 hym suche a power / he was sore adrad / and sente for syr Andrewe of Herkela / and with hym spake / & sayd to hym in this maner. Syr Andrewe sayd he / ye may well vnderstande how y
t
 out lorde the kynge is ladde and mysgouer∣ned by moche false coūsey
e through syr Hugh Spenser the fader and syr Hugh his sone / & syr Iohn erle of Arundell / & through mayster Robert Baldok a false pylled clerke / that now is dwellyng in y
e
 kynges courte. Wherfore I praye you that ye wyll come with vs with all the power that ye haue ordeyned & helpe to destroye y
e
 venym of Englonde, and the traytours that ben therin / and we wyll gyue vnto you all y
e
 best parte of .v. 
∣domes that we haue & holde / & we wyll make vnto you an othe y
t
 we wyll neuer do thynge without your counseyle / & so ye shall be eft as well w
t
 vs as euer was Robert Holand. Than answered syr An∣drewe of Herkela & sayd. Syr Thomas that wold I not do no consent therto for no maner thȳge ye myght me gyue w
t
∣out the wyll & cōmaūdement of our lord the kynge / for than sholde I be holden a traytour for euermore. And whan y
t
 the noble erle Thomas of Lancastre sawe y
t
 he wolde not consent to hym for no ma∣ner thynge / he sayd. Syr Andrew wyll ye not consent to destroye y
e
 ve
 of the realme as we be / consent at one worde / syr Andrewe I tell the that or this yere be passed that ye shall be taken & holden for a traytour / and more than ony of you holde vs now / & of a worse deth ye shall dye than euer dyd knyght in Englōde / & vnderstāde well y
t
 ye dyd neuer thynge y
t
 sorer shal repēt you / & now go & do what


you good lyketh / & I wyll put me in to the mercy of god. And so wente the fals traytour tyraūt and as a fals forsworne man. For through y
e
 noble erle Thomas of Lancastre he receyued the armes of chyualry / & of hym was made knyght. Than myght men searchers drawe thē on that one syde & on y
t
 other / & knightes also / & thā fought togyder wonders sore And also amonge all other syr Humfrey de Boughon erle of Herforde a worthy knyght of renome through all chrysten∣dom stode & fought with his enemyes vpon the brydge / & as y
e
 noble lorde stode & fought vpon y
e
 brydge / a thefe rybaud skulked vnder the brydge & fyersly with a spere smote the noble knyght in to the foūdament / so y
e
 his bowelles fell about his feet. Alas for sorowe / for there was slayne the floure of solace & cōforte & also of curteysy. And syr Roger of Clifford a noble knyght stode euer & fought / & well & worthely hym defended / but at y
e
 last he was sore wounded in his heed / & syr Willyam of S
llay & syr Roger of Ber∣nefelde were slayue at y
t
 batayle. Whan syr Andrewe of Herkela sawe y
t
 syr Tho∣mas men of Lancastre lessed & slaked / a∣none he & his company came vnto y
e
 gen¦tyll 
ayght / & sayd vnto hym w
t
 an hye voyce. Yelde the traitour yelde the. The gentyll erle Thomas than answered & sayd. Nay lordes / traitours be we none & to you we wyll vs neuer yelde whyle that our lyues lasteth / but rather wyll we dye
 our treuth than yelde vs vnto you. And syr Andrewe agayne behelde syr Thomas & his company yellynge & cryenge as a wood wolfe & sayd. Yelde you traytours taken yelde you / sayenge with an hye voyce / beware syrs y
t
 none of you be so hardy vpon lyfe & ly
 
e to mis
o Thomas body of Lancastre. And with that worde the good erle Thomas went into the cha
e
 and sayd k
elyng vpon his knees / and turned his vysage towarde the crosse and sayd. Almyghty god vnto the I yelde me / & holly I put me vnto thy mercy. And with that the vylayns & rybaudes lepte aboute hym on euery syde as tyrauntes & wood tur∣mentours / and despoyled hym of his ar mure / and clothed hym in a robe of raye that was of his squyers lyuerey / & forth ladde hym vnto Yorke by water. Than myght men se moche sorowe & care. For the gentyll knyghtes fled on euery syde and y
e
 rybaudes & vylayns egerly them descryed / and cryed on hygh / yelde you traytours yelde you. And whan they were yolden / they were robbed & boūde as theues. Alas the shame and despyte that y
e
 gentyll ordre of knyghthode had there at that batayle. And the lond was than without lawe / for holy chirche had than no more reuerence thā yf it had ben a brodell hous. And in that batayle was the fader against the sone / and the vncle agaynst the neuewe. For so moche vn∣kyndnes there was neuer seen before in Englonde as was that tyme amonge folkes of one nacyon. For one kynrede had no more 
yte on that other / than an ho
gry wolfe hath of a shepe, & it was no wonder. For the grete lordes of Eng∣londe were not all borne of o
 
a
yon / but were 
edled with other na
s / that is for to saye / some were Brytons some Sa
o
s / some 
nes / some Pe∣hytes / some Fren

des / Romayns / Heno
ers / 
 F
em
ges / with m
y other 
oyons the whiche nacyons ac
ed not to the kynde blode of Englond. And yf so gret
 lordes ha
 bē onely 
dded 
o 
nglysshe people / than sholde rest and pe
s haue ben a
ge them without o
y en
y. And at y
e
 batayle were taken prysoners syr Roger E
ord / syr Iohn M
bray syr Wyllyam Tuchit / syr Willyam 
itz


Willyam / & many other worthy knygh tes there were takē at that batayle. And syr Hugh Dandell the nexte daye after was taken & put in to prison / and sholde haue bē done to deth yf he had not spou∣sed the kynges nece that was erle Gyl∣bertes syster of Glocestre. And anone af∣ter was syr Barth
mew of Badelsmere taken at Stowe parke / a manoyr of the bysshop of Lyncolnes / that was his ne∣uewe / & many other barons & baronets wherfore was made moche sorowe.






¶ How syr Thomas of Lancastre was byheded at Pountfret / and .v. barons & a knyght drawen & hanged there.


NOw I shall tell you of the noble erle syr Thomas of Lancastre. Whan he was taken & brought to yorke many of the cyte were full glad / & vpon hym cryed with an hygh voyce. O syr traytour ye be welcome / blyssed be god / for now ye shall haue the rewarde that longe tyme ye haue deserued. And cast vpon hym many snowe balles / & many other reproues they dyd hym. But the gentyll erle suffred all and sayd not one worde agayne. And at y
e
 same tyme the kynge herde of this discōfyture / & was full glad / and in haste came to Poūtfret and syr Hugh Spenser & syr Hugh his sone / & syr Iohn erle of Arundel / and syr Edmond of wodstok the kynges broder erle of Kent / syr Aymer of Valaūce erle of Penbroke / & mayster Robert Baldok a fals pylled clerke / that was preuy and dwelled in the kynges courte / & all came thyder with the kynge. And the kynge entred in to the castell. And syr Andrewe of Herkela a fals tyraūt through y
e
 kyn∣ges cōmaundement toke with hym the gentyll erle Thomas to Pountfret / and there he was prysoned in his owne ca∣stell that he had newe made / that stode agaynst the abbey of kynge Edwarde. And syr Hugh Spenser the fader & his sone cast in theyr thoughtes how and in what maner the good erle Thomas of Lancastre 
shold
 be put to deth without ony iudgemēt of his peres. Wherfore it was ordeyned through y
e
 kynges Iusti∣ces that the kynge 
shold
 put vpon hym poyntes of treason. And so it befell that he was ledde to barre before the kynges Iustices bare heded as a thefe in a fayre hall in his own castell where as he had made many a grete feest to riche & poore. And these were his Iustices syr Hugh Spenser the fader / & Aymer of 
a
a
e erle of Penbroke / syr Edmōd of wodstok erle of Kent / syr Iohn of Brytayn erle of Rychmond / & syr Robert Mal
m
 Iustice / & this syr Robert him acou
ped in this maner. Thomas at the first our lorde y
e
 kyng & this courte excludeth y
u of all maner answere. Thomas our l
d the kyng putteth vpon you y
t
 ye haue 
 his lōd ryden w
t
 baner displayed against his peas as a traytour. And with that worde y
t
 gentyll erle Thomas w
t
 an 
 voyce sayd. Nay lordes forsoth & by 
a
 Thomas I was neuer traytour. The Iustyce sayd agayn. Thomas our 
lord
 the kyng putteth vpō you y
t
 ye haue rob¦bed his folke & murdred his people as a thefe. Thomas also y
e
 kyng putteth 
 you y
t
 he discōfyted you & your people w
t
 his folke in his owne realme wherfore ye went & 
ed to y
e
 wode as an 
. And Thomas as a traitour ye ought to be hanged by reason but the kyng hath forgyuen you that Iudgement for 
ue of quene Isabell. And Thomas reason wolde that ye sholde be hanged but the kynge hath forgyuen you y
t
 
udgement for loue of your lygnage. But Thomas for as moche as ye were taken fleynge & as an ou
lawe y
e
 kyng wyll y
t
 your heed be smytten of as ye haue well deserued


Anoue haue hym out of pr
es & brynge hym to his iudgement. Whan y
e
 gentyll knyght Thomas had herd al these wor des / with an hye voyce he cryed sore we∣pyng & sayd. Alas saint Thomas fayre fader / alas shall I be deed thus. Graūt me now blissedfull god answere. But all auayled hym 
o thynge. For the cursed Gascoyns put hym hyder & thyder / & on hym cryed w
t
 an hye voyce. O kyng Ar∣thur moost terryble and dredefull / well knowen is now thyn open traytory / an euyll deth shalt thou anone dye / as thou hast well deserued it. And than they set vpon his heed in scorne an olde chapelet that was all to rent that was not worth an halfpeny. And after that they set hȳ vpon a l
ne whyte palfrey full vnseme∣ly / & also all bare / & with an olde brydell and with an horryble noyse they droue hym out of the castell toward his deth / and they cast vpon hym many balles of snowe in despyte. And as the traytours ladde hym out of the castel he sayd these pyteous wordes / holdynge vp his han∣des towarde heuen. Now the kynge of heuen gyue vs mercy / for y
e
 erthly kyng hath vs forsaken. And a frere prechour went with hym out of the castell tyll he came to the place that he ended his lyfe / vnto whom he shroue hȳ of all his lyfe. And the gentyll erle helde the frere won¦ders fast by the clothes & sayd to hym. Fayre fader abyde with vs tyll that I be deed / for my flesshe quaketh for drede of deth. And the sothe to saye / the gentyl erle set hym vpon his knees and turned hym towarde y
e
 eest. But a rybaud that was called Higone of Moston set hande vpon the gentyl erle / & sayd in despyte of hym. Syr traytour turne the toward y
e
 Scottes thy foule dethe to receyue / and turned hym toward the north. The no∣ble erle Thomas answered than with a mylde voyce & sayd. Now fayre lordes I shall do your wyll. And with y
e
 worde the frere went from hym sore wepynge And anone a rybaud wente to hym and smote of his heed the .xi. 
Kal.
 of Apryll / in the yere of grace. M .CCC. and .xxi. Alas y
t
 euer suche a gentyll blode sholde be put to deth w
t

e
 Spensers suffred syr Thomas his vn∣cles sone to be put to suche a deth & so by heded agaynst all reason. And grete pite it was also y
t
 suche a noble kynge sholde be deceyued and mysgouerned through coūseyle of y
e
 fals Spensers the whiche he maynteyned through loselry against his honour & also {pro}fyte. For afterwarde there fell grete vengeaūce in Englonde bycause of the foresayd Thomas dethe. ¶ Whan the gentyll erle of his lyf was passed / the pryour & y

¶ How kyng Edward went in to Scot∣londe with an hondred thousande men of armes / and myght not spede.


ANd whā kyng Edward of Eng∣londe had brought the floure of chyualry vnto theyr deth through coun seyle & consent of syr Hugh Spenser the fader / and syr Hugh the sone / he became as wood as ony lyon. And what so euer the Spensers wolde haue / it was done / so well the kynge loued them that they myght do w
t
 hym all thynge y
t
 them ly∣ked / wherfore y
e
 kyng gaue to syr Hugh Spenser the fader the erledom of Wyn∣chestre / & to syr Andrewe of Herkela the erledom of Cardoyll in preiudyce and in harmynge of his crowne. And kyng Ed¦ward than through coūseyle of y
e
 Spen¦sers disheryted all them that had ben a∣gaynst hȳ in ony quarell w
t
 Thomas of Lancastre / & many other were dishery∣ted also / bycause y
t
 the Spensers couey∣ted to haue theyr lōdes / & so they had all that they wolde desyre with wronge & agaynst all reason. Than made y
e
 kyng Robert Baldok a fals pylled clerke chaū celer of Englonde / through coūseyle of y
e
 foresayd Spensers / & he was a fals ry∣baude and a couetous. And so they coū∣seyled the kyng moche that the kyng let take to his own warde all y
e
 goodes of y
e
 lordes y
t
 were put wrongfully to deth in to his own hādes. And as well they toke the goodes y
t
 were w
t
in holy chirche as y
e
 goodes y
t
 were w
t
out / & let them be put in to his tresoury in London / & let them call his forfeytes. And by theyr coūseyle the kyng wrought / for euermore he dis∣heryted them y
t
 ought the goodes. And through theyr coūse
le let arere a tallage of all y
e
 goodes of Englond / wherfore he was y
e
 richest kyg y
e
 euer was in englōd after Willyam bas
ard of Norman
y y
e
 conquered Englonde. And yet through counseyle of them hy semed y
e
 he had not ynough / but made yet euery towne of Englonde for to fynde a man of armes vpon theyr own costes / for to go & warre vpon the Scottes y
t
 were his enemyes / wherfore y
e
 kyng went in to scotlonde w
t
 an .C. M. men of armes at whitsontyde in y
e
 yere of our lord. M .CCC .xxij. But the scottes went & hyd them in wodes & in mountaynes & taryed y
e
 englysshmen fro day to day / y
t
 the kyng myght for no maner thȳge fynde them in playn
 
 wherfore many englisshmen y
e
 had 
 vytayles dyed there for honger wōders fast / & sod
ynly in goynge & comynge & namely those that had ben against Tho¦mas of Lācastre & robbed his men vpon his lōdes. Whan kyng Edward sawe y
t
 vytayles fayled hym / he was wonders sore dyscōforted / bycause also y
t
 his men dyed: & for he might not spede of his ene∣myes. So at y
e
 last he came aga
 to Englōde. And anone after came Iames douglas & also Thomas 
 huge hoost into Northumberlonde & w
t
 them y
e
 englysshmen y
t
 were dryuen out of Englonde / & came & robbed y
e
 
 & slewe the people & also br
nt a 
owne that was called Northall
 & many other townes to Yorke. And whan the kyng herde these tydynges he let 
m
n all maner of men that myght trauayle. And so the Englysshmen mette y
•
 Scot∣tes at the abbey of 
eyghlonde the .xv. daye after Myghelmasse in y
•
 sam
 yere aboue sayd and the Englysshmen were discomfyted. And at that dyscomfytu
 was taken syr Iohn of Brytayn erle of Rychemond that helde the coūtre
 and the erledome of Lancastre and after he


payed an huge raunsom and was let go And after that he went in to Fraunce / & came neuer afterwarde agayne.






¶ How syr Andrewe of Herkela was ta∣ken & put to deth y
•
 was erle of Cardoyll.


THan at y
•
 tyme was syr Andrew of Herkela that newe was made erle of Cardoyll / bycause y
•
 he had taken the good erle Thomas of Lancastre. He had ordeyned through y
•
 kynges cōmaū demēt of Englonde for to brynge him all the power y
•
 he myght for to helpe hȳ a∣gaynst y
•
 Scottes at y

 abbey of Beygh∣londe. And whan the fals traytour had gadred all y
•
 people y
•
 he myght & sholde haue comē to y
•
 king to y
•
 abbey of Beigh¦lond / the fals traytour ladde them by an other countree through Copelonde / and through y
•
 erledom of Lancastre / & went through y
•
 coūtree & robbed & slewe folke all y
•
 he myght. And ferthermore y
•
 fals traytour had taken a grete sōme of gold & syluer of syr Iames Douglas for to be agaynst y

 kyng of Englond / & to be hel∣pyng & holdyng w
t
 the scottes / through whose treason y
•
 kyng of Englond was discomfyted at Beighlonde or y
•
 he came thyder. Wherfore y
•
 kynge was toward hym wonders wroth / & let pryuely en∣quyre by y
•
 coūtre aboute how y
•
 it was. And so men enquyred & espyed / that at y
•
 last the trouth was foūde & sought / and he atteynt & taken as a fals traitour / as the good erle Thomas of Lācastre hym tolde / or that he was put to dethe at his takynge at Burbrydge / & to hym sayd / or that yere were done he shold be taken & holden a traytour. And so it was as y
•
 holy man sayd. Wherfore the kyng sent priuely to syr Anthony of Lucy a knight of the coūtree of Cardoyll that he sholde take syr Andrewe of Herkela & put hym to deth. And to bryng this thynge to an ende / the kynge sente his cōmyssyon / so that this same Andrewe was taken at Cardoyll & ledde to the barre in y
•
 maner of an erle worthely arayed / and with a swerde gyrde aboute hym / and boted & sporred. Thā spake syr Anthony in this maner / syr Andrewe sayd he / the kynge putteth vpon the for as moche as y
•
 hast benorped in thy dedes he dyd to the mo∣che honour / & made the erle of Cardoyll & thou as a traytour to thy lorde laddest the people of his countree y
•
 sholde haue holpe hym at y
•
 batayle of Beighlond / & thou laddest them away by y
•
 coūtree of Copelonde & through y
•
 erledom of Lan∣castre / wherfore our lorde y
•
 kynge was discōfyted there of the Scottes through thy treason & falsnes / & yf thou haddest comen betymes he had had the batayle / And treason y
•
 dydest for y
•
 grete somme of gold and syluer that thou receyued of Iames Douglas a Scotte the kynges enemy. And our lorde y
•
 kyng wyll that the ordre of knyghthode by the whiche y

 receyued all thyne honour and worship vpon thy body / be all brought to nought & thyne estate vndone / y
•
 other knightes of lower degree may after be ware / the whiche 
lord
 hath hugely auaunced the in dyuers coūtrees of Englonde / & that all may take ensample by y
•
 / theyr lorde afterward truly for to serue. Than com¦maūded he a knaue anoue to hewe of his sporres on his heles. And after he lette breke the swerde ouer his heed / the whi¦che the kyng gaue hym for to kepe & de∣fende his londe therwith whan he had made hym erle of Cardoyl. And after he let hȳ be vnclothed of his furred tabard and of his hode / & of his furred cotes / & of his gyrdell. And whā this was done syr Anthony sayd than to hym. Andrew sayd he / now arte thou no knyght / but a knaue / and for thy treason the kynge wyll that y
•
 shalte be hanged & drawen / 


and thy heed smytten of / & thy bowelles taken out of thy body & brent before the & thy body quartred / & thy heed sente to Londō / & there it shall stande vpon Lon∣don brydge / & the foure quarters shal be sente to foure townes of Englonde / that all other may be ware & chastised by the And as syr Anthony said / so it was done all maner thynge on y
•
 last daye of Octo∣ber / in the yere of grace. M .CCC .xxij. And y

 sonne turned in to blode as y

 peo∣ple it sawe / & that dured from y

¶ Of y
•
 myracles that god wrought for saynt Thomas of Lancastre / wherfore the kynge let close in the chirche dores of the pryory of Pountfret / that no man sholde come therin for to offre.


ANd soone after that y
•
 good erle Thomas of Lācastre was mar∣tyred / there was a preest that lōge tyme had ben blynde / dremed in his slepe y
•
 he sholde go to y
•
 hyll there y
•
 good erle Tho∣mas of Lancastre was put to deth / & he sholde haue his syght agayn / & so he dre¦med thre nyghtes suynge / & y
•
 preest let lede him to y
•
 same hyll / & whan he came to the place y
•
 he was martyred on / full deuoutly he made there his prayers / & prayed god & saȳt Thomas y
•
 he myght haue his syght agayne / & as he was in his prayers / he layde his ryght hande vpon y
•
 same place y
•
 the good man was martyred on / and a drop of drye blode & small sande cleued on his hande / & ther∣with stryked his eyen / & anone through the myght of god and saint Thomas he had his syght agayne / & thanked than almyghty god & saynt Thomas. ¶ And whā this myracle was knowen amōge men / y
•
 people came thyder on euery syde and kneled & made theyr prayers at his tombe that is in y
•
 pryory of Poūtfret / & prayed y
•
 holy martyr of socour & helpe / & god herde theyr prayers. ¶ Also there was a yonge childe drowned in a welle in y
•
 towne of Poūtfret / & was deed thre dayes & thre nyghtes / and men came & layde y
•
 deed chilo
 vpon saynt Thomas tombe y
•
 holy martyr / & the chylde arose frō deth to lyfe / as many a man it sawe. ¶ Also moche people were out of theyr mynde / & god sent them theyr mynde a∣gayn / through vertue of y
•
 holy martyr. ¶ Also god hath gyuen there to exepyls theyr goynge / & to croked theyr handes & theyr feet / & to blynde also theyr fyght and to many seke folke theyr helth of by¦uers dyseases / for y
•
 loue of this martyr. ¶ Also there was a ryche man in Co
 dom in Gascoyn / and suche a malady he had that all his ryght syde ro
ed & fell away frō hym y
•
 men might se his 
uer & his herte / & so he stanke y
•
 vnneth men myght come nye hȳ / wherfore his fren∣des were for hym wonders sory / but at the last as god wold they prayd to saynt Thomas of Lancastre y
•
 he 
wold
 praye to god for that prisoner / & behyght to go to Poūtfret for to do theyr pylgrymage he thought y
•
 the martyr sam
 Thomas came to him & anou
ted ouer all his seke body / & therwith the good man aweke & was all hole / & his flesshe was restored agayn y
•
 before was torred & fallē away For whiche myracle the good man & his frendes loued god & saint Thomas euer more after. And this good man came in to Englonde / & toke with hym foure se∣lowes and came to Poūtfret to the holy martyr / & dyd theyr pylgrymage / & the good man that was seke came thyder al naked / saue his preuy clothes. And whā they had done / they turned home agayn in to theyr owne roūtree / and tolde of the myracle where so euer that they came. ¶ And also two men haue bē heled there of the mormale / through helpe of y
•
 holy


martyr / though that euyll be holden in∣curable. ¶ And whan y
•
 Spensers herd that god dyd suche myracles for this ho¦ly man / they wold not byleue it in no ma¦ner wyse / but said openly y
•
 it was grete heresy suche vertue of hȳ to byleue. And whan syr Hugh Spenser the sone sawe all this doynge / anone he sente his mes∣senger from Poūtfret where as he dwe∣led to kyng Edward / that than was at Grauen at Scipton / bycause y
•
 the kyng sholde vndo y
•
 pylgrymage. And as y
•
 ry baud messenger went to ward the kyng for to do his message / he came by the hyll where as the good martyr was done to deth / & in the same place he made his or∣dure / & whā he had done he rode toward the king / & a stronge flyxe came vpon hȳ or that he came to Yorke / & thā he shedde all his bowels at his foundament. And whan syr Hugh Spenser herde these ty dynges / somdele he was adradde / and thought for to vndo y
•
 pilgrymage yf he myght by ony maner waye. And anone he went to the kyng & sayd y
•
 they 
shold
 be in grete sclaūdre through out all chry stendom for the deth of Thomas of Lan¦castre / yf that he suffred the people to dō theyr pylgrymage at Pountfret / & so he coūseyled y
•
 kyng y
•
 he cōmaūded to close the chirche dores of Poūtfret / in y
•
 whi∣che y
•
 holy martyr was buryed / & thus they dyd agaynst all fraūchyses of holy chirche / so y
•
 foure yere after myght no pylgrym come to y
•
 holy body / & bycause that the monkes suffred men to come & honour y
•
 holy body of saynt Thomas y
•
 martyr / through counseyle of syr Hugh Spenser the sone / & through coūseyle of mayster Robert Baldok the false pylled clerke the kynges chaunceler / the kyng consented that they sholde be set to theyr wages: & let make wardeyns ouer theyr own good longe tyme / & through cōmaū dement of y
•
 foresayd syr Hugh Spenser xiiij. gascoyns well armed kept the hyll where as the good man saynt Thomas was done to dethe / so that no pylgrym might come by y
•
 waye. Full well wend he to haue taken Chrystes myght & his power & the grete boos of myracles that he shewed for his martyr saȳt Thomas through all christendom. And that same tyme the king made Robert Baldok the fals pylled clerke through prayer of syr Hugh Spensers sone chaūceler of Eng∣londe. And in y
•
 same tyme was y
•
 castell of Walyngford holden agaynst y
•
 kynge through y
•
 prysoners that were w
t
in the castell for saynt Thomas quarell of Lan¦castre. Wherfore the people of y
•
 coūtree came & toke the castell vpon y
•
 prisoners. Wherfore syr John Goldington knight & syr Edmond of Beche prisoners / and a squyer y
t
 was Roger of Walton were ta¦ken & sent to y
•
 kyng to Poūtfret / & there they were put in prison / & y
•
 foresayd Ro¦ger was sent to yorke / and there he was drawen & hanged. And anone after syr Roger Mortimer of wigmore brake out of the Toure of London in this maner. The foresayd Roger herde y
t
 he 
shold
 be drawen & hanged at London on the mo∣rowe after saynt Laurence daye / & on y
•
 daye before he helde a fayre feest in the toure of London / & there was syr Ste∣phen Segraue cōstable of y
•
 toure & ma∣ny grete men w
t
 them / & whā they 
shold
 soupe / y
•
 foresayd Stephen sent for all y
•
 officers of y

 toure / & they came & souped with hym / & whā they shold take theyr leue of hȳ / a squyer y
t
 hyght Stephen y
t
 was full preuy with the foresaid Roger through his coūseyle gaue them suche a drȳke y
•
 the lest of them al slept .ij. days & ij. nyghtes / & in the meane tyme he esca¦ped away by y
•
 ryuer of Tamys / & went ouer y
•
 see & helde hym in Fraūce. Wher¦fore the king was sore anoyed / & put the same Stephen out of his Cōstablery.








¶ How quene. Isabell went in to Fraū∣ce for to treate of peas bytwene her lorde the kynge of Englonde and the kynge of Fraunce her broder.


THe kynge went than to London and there through coūseyle of syr Hugh Spenser the fader & of his sone & of mayster Robert Baldok a fals pylled clerke his chaunceler / let sease than all the quenes londes in to his handes / and also all the londes y
•
 were syr Edwardes his sone / & were so put to theyr wages agaynst all maner of reason / & that was through y

 falsnes of the Spensers. And whan the kyng of Fraūce y
t
 was quene Isabelles broder herde of this falsnes / he was sore anoyed agaynst y
•
 kynge of Englonde & his fals coūseylers. Wher∣fore he sent a lettre to kyng Edward vn∣der his seale / y
t
 he shold come in to Fraū∣ce at a certayn day for to do his homage & therto he somoned hym / & els he shold lese all Gascoyn. ¶ And so it was ordey∣ned in Englond through the kyng & his coūseyle that quene Isabell sholde go in to Fraūce for to treate of peas bytwene her lorde & her broder. And that Olyuer of yngham sholde go in to Gascoyn / and haue with hym .vij. M. men of armes & more / to be senesshall & wardeyn of Gas∣coyn. And so it was ordeyned that quene Isabell went in to Fraunce / & with her went syr Aymer of Valaūce erle of Pen broke / that was there murdred sodeyn∣ly in a preuy syege / but y
t
 was through goddes vengeaūce / for he was one of the Iustyces y

 consented to saynt Thomas deth of Lancastre / & wolde neuer after tepent him of that wycked dede. And at that tyme syr Olyuer of yngham went ouer in to Gascoyn / & dyd moche harme to the kyng of Fraūce / and than he gate agayne that kynge Edwarde had lost / and moche more therto.






¶ How kynge Edwarde sent syr Ed∣ward his sone the eldest in to Fraūce.


THe quene Isabell had but a quar¦ter of a yere dwelled in Fraunce whan syr Edward her eldest sone as

 I gyue you y

 they 
shold
 be holden as enemyes / bothe to y

¶ How kynge Edward through coun∣seyle of the Spensers sente to the douze pers of Fraunce that they sholde helpe that the quene Isabell & her sone syr Ed¦ward were exiled out of Fraunce.


WHan kynge Edward & the Spen∣sers herde how y
t
 quene Isabell & syr Edward her sone had alyed them to the erle of Henaud / & to them that were exiled out of Englonde for cause of Tho∣mas of Lācastre / they were so sory that they wyst not what to do. Wherfore syr Hugh Spenser y

wold
 not so For whā this Arnold was in y
e
 hygh see he was taken with Selanders y
t
 mette hym in the hygh see / & toke hym & ladde hym to the erle of Henaud theyr lorde / & moche ioye was made for that takyng. And at the last this Arnold pryuely stale away fro thens & came to London. And of this takyng and of other thynges the erle of Henaud sayd to the quene Isabell Dame make you mery & be of good che∣re / for ye be richer than ye wend to haue

And almyghty god graunte you grace your enemyes to ouercome. Than sent the quene Isabell through Henaud and Flaūdres for her soudyours / and ordey∣ned her euery daye for to goo in to Eng∣londe agayne. And so she had in her com¦pany syr Edmonde of Woodstocke / that was erle of Kent / and was also syr Ed∣wardes broder of Englonde.






¶ How kyng Edward let kepe y

Nd whan kyng Edward herde tell that quene Isabel & Edward her sone wolde come in to Englond with a grete power of alyens / and with them that were outlawed out of Englonde for theyr rebellyousnes / he was sore adrad to be put downe / and for to lese his kyng¦dome / wherfore he ordeyned to kepe his castels in Wales as well as in Englond with vytayles & theyr apparayle / & let kepe his riuers & also y

¶ How mayster Walter Stapylton bisshop of Excestre y
e
 was the kynges tresourer was heded at London.


Nd in the same tyme kyng Ed∣ward was sore adrad lest y
t
 men of London wolde yelde them to y
e
 quene Isabel & to her sone Edward. Wherfore he set mayster Walter Stapylton his tresourer for to be wardeyn & keper of y
e
 cite of London w
t
 the Mayre / & so came to the 
ylde hall of London / & asked the keyes of the gates of the Cyte / through


vertue and strength of his cōmyssyon / & wolde haue had y
e
 kepyng of y
e
 cite. And the comuners answered and sayd that they wolde kepe the cite to the honour of kynge Edwarde & of Isabell the quene and of the duke y
e
 kynges sone w
t
out ony moo. Than was y
e
 bysshop sore anoyed / and swore othes y
t
 they all sholde abye it anone as kynge Edwarde were comen out of Wales. And all the comuners of the Cite anone toke the bysshop & ladde hym amyddes of the Chepe / and there they smote of his heed / & set his heed in his ryght hande. And after they heded two of his squyers that helde with the bysshop / & one of them was called Wyl∣lyam of Wayle / that was the bysshops neuewe / & that other was called Iohn of Padington. And also they toke a bur∣geys of London that was called Iohn Marshall / that was syr Hugh spensers spye the fader / & smote of his heed also. In the same tyme y
t
 bisshop had at Lon¦don a fayre toure in makyng in his close vpon the ryuer of Tamys / y
t
 was w
t
out temple barre / & stone fayled to make an ende therof / wherfore he cōmanded his men to go to the freres Carmes / & there they toke stone to make therw
t
 the toure & moche sande & morter & olde robous y
t
 was lefte. And for the despyte y
t
 the bys∣shop had done vnto holy chirche: he & his two squyers were buryed in y
e
 sande / as though they had ben hoūdes / and there they laye .xj. wekes / tyll that the quene Isabell sent her lettres to the comuners & prayed them that they wolde suffre & graūt / that the bysshop myght be taken out of y
e
 place & be buryed at Excestre in his own chirche / & so he was / & his two squyers were buryed at saint Clemētes chirche w
t
out temple barre. And it was no wonder though that bysshop dyed an euyl deth / for he was a couetous man / & had w
t
 hym no mercy / & euyll coūseylled the kynge. And soone after was Arnold of Spayne taken / that assented to haue ladde .v. M. poūde of syluer in .v. barels ferryers vnto y
e
 douze
ers of Fraūce / for to helpe & haste the quene Isabell to her deth / & Edward her sone also. And this Arnold was put to deth w
t
out the cite.






¶ How kyng Edward & syr Hugh spen∣ser & the erle of Arundell were taken.


WHan kynge Edwarde had sente mayster Walter Stap
lton his tresourer to London / for to kepe the cite vnto hym agaynst y
e
 quene Isa∣bell his wyfe / & agaynst Edwarde his sone / anone hymselfe toke with hym sir Hugh Spenser y
e
 sene / and syr Iohn o
 Arundell / & mayster Robert Ba
dok his chaunceler a fals pylled prcest / and toke theyr waye toward Brystowe / & there y
e
 kynge abode a lytell tyme / and made syr Hugh Spenser the fader as Cōstable & keper of y
e
 castell. And y
e
 kȳg & that other spenser went to shyppe & sayled toward Wales / & toke no leue of y
e
 steward n
 of none of y
e
 kynges houshold & w
 euer in to Wales for to arere the W
 agaynst dame Isabel the quene and the duke her sone / & the erle of Kent and syr Iohn of Henaud. And they went & pur∣sued after thē / & theyr power encreased dayly. So at y
e
 last the kyng was taken vpon an hyll in Wales & syr Hugh spen¦ser y
e
 sone on y
e
 other syde of y
e
 same 
yll / & the false pylled clerke mayster Robert Baldok there fast besydes them / & they were brought agayn in to Englonde as almyghty god wolde. And y
e
 kyng hym selfe was put in safe kepyng in y
e
 castell of Kelynworth / & hym kepte syr Henry that was saynt Thomas broder of Lan¦castre. And syr Hugh y
e
 fader came & put hym in the quenes grace & syr Edwarde her sone duke of Guy
. But syr Hugh


Spenser after the tyme y
•
 he was taken he wolde neyther ete nor drynke / for he wyst well he 
shold
 haue no mercy / saue onely to be deed. And the quene & her coū seyle had ordeyned that he sholde haue ben done to deth at London / but he was so feble for his moche fastynge y
•
 he was nygh deed / & therfore it was ordeyned y
•
 he shold haue his iudgement at Herford And at a place of y
•
 toure his hode was taken frō his heed / & also frō Robert Bal dok y
t
 fals pylled clerke & y
•
 kynges chaū celer / & mē set vpō theyr hedes chaplets of sharpe nettyls / & two squyers blewe in theyr eres w
t
 two grete bugles hornes vpon the two prisouers / that one myght here theyr blowynge more than a myle. And one Symond of Redyng y
•
 kynges marshall bare before them vpon a spere theyr armes reuersed: in token that they sholde be vndone for euermore. And on y
•
 morowe was syr Hugh Spenser y
•
 sone dampned to deth / & was drawen & han∣ged & heded / & his bowelles taken out of his body & brent / & after y
t
 he was quar∣tred / & his .iiij. quarters were sent to. iiij townes of Englonde / & his heed sente to London brydge. And this Symond for cause that he despysed quene Isabell he was drawen & hanged on a stage made amyddes y
•
 foresaid syr Hughs galowes And y
•
 same daye a lytell frō thens was syr Iohn of Arundell byheded / bycause he was one of syr Hugh Spenses coun∣seylers. And anone after was syr Hugh Spenser y
•
 fader drawen & hanged & he∣ded at Brystowe / & after hanged agayn by the armes w
t
 two stronge ropes: & the fourth day after he was hewen all to pe ces / & hoūdes ete hym. And bycause the kyng had gyuen hym y
•
 erledom of wyn chestre his heed was put vpon a spere & sente thyder. And the fals Baldok was sent to London / & there he dyed in prison amōge theues / for men dyd hȳ no more reuerence than they wold do to a dogge. And so dyed y
•
 traytours of Englōd blis∣sed be god. And it was no wonder / for through theyr coūseyle y
•
 good erle Tho mas of Lācastre was done to deth / & all that helde with Thomas of Lancastre through the traytours were vndone / & all theyr heyres disheryted.






¶ How kyng Edward was put downe and his dignite taken from hym.


ANd anone after as all this was done / quene Isabell & Edwarde her sone duke of Guyenne / & all the grete lordes of Englonde at one assent sente to kyng Edward to y
•
 castell of Kenilworth where as he was in kepynge vnder the warde of syr Iohn Hachim that was y
•
 bysihop of Ely / & of syr Iohn of Percy a baron / for bycause that he sholde ordeyn his parlyament at a certayne place in Englond / for to redresse and amende the estate of the realme. And kyng Edward them answered & sayd. Lordes sayd he ye se full well how it is / lo haue here my seale / and I gyue you all my power for to ordeyne a parlyament where that ye wyll. And than they toke theyr leue of hym & came agayn to y
•
 barons of Eng∣londe. And whan they had the kynges patent of this thynge / they shewed it to the lordes. And than was ordeyned that the parliament shold be at westmynster at the vtas of saynt Hylary. And all the grete lordes of Englonde let ordeyne for them there agaynst that tyme that the parlyament sholde be. At whiche daye that y
•
 parlyament was / the kyng wol∣de not come there for no maner thynge as he had set hymselfe & assygned. And neuerthelesse the barons sent vnto hym one tyme & other. And he swore by god∣des soule that he wolde not come there one fote. Wherfore it was ordeyned by all the grete Lordes of Englonde that


he sholde no longer be kyng / but be depo sed / & sayd they wolde crowne Edward his sone y
•
 elder y
t
 was duke of Guyenne And sent tydynges vnto the kyng there as he was in warde vnder syr Iohn erle of Garen / & syr Iohn of Bothun y
t
 was bysshop of Ely / & syr Henry Percy a ba∣ron / & syr Willyam Trussell a knyght y
•
 was with y
•
 erle Thomas of Lancastre for to yeld vp theyr homages vnto hym for all them of Englonde. And syr Wyl∣lyam Trussell sayd these wordes. Syr Edward / bycause that ye haue betrayed your people of Englond / & haue vndone many grete lordes or 
Englond
 without ony cause / ye shall be deposed / & now ye be withstande thanked be god. And also bycause that ye wold not come to y
•
 par∣liament as ye ordeyned at Westmynster as in your owne lettre patent is contey∣ned / for to treate w
t
 your lyege men as a kyng sholde. And therfore through all y
•
 comyns assent & of all the lordes of Eng∣londe I tell vnto you these wordes. Ye shall vnderstande syr that the barons of Englond at one assent wyll that ye be no more king of Englond / but vtterly haue put you out of your ryalte for euermore. And the bysshop of Ely than sayd to the kynge. Syr Edwarde here I yelde vp feaute & homage for all y
•
 archebisshops & bysshops of Englond & for all y
•
 clergy. Than sayd syr Iohn erle of Garen. Syr Edward I yelde vp here vnto you feau te and homage for me & for all y
•
 erles of Englōde. And syr Henry Percy gaue vp also there his homage for him & for all y
•
 barons of Englonde. And than sayd syr William Trussell. I yelde vp now vnto you syr myn homage for me & for all the knyghtes of Englonde / & for all them y
•
 holde by sergeaūtry or by ony other ma∣ner thynge of you / so y
•
 from this day af terward ye shall not be claymed kynge / nor for kynge be holden. But from this tyme afterwarde ye shall be holden for a singuler man of all y
•
 people. And so they went thens to London / where y
•
 lordes of Englonde abode them / & syr Edward abode in prison i good kepyng. And this was on the daye of y
•
 cōuersyon of saynt Paule / in the .xx. yere of his regne.






¶ Of the prophery of Merlyn de∣clared of kynge Edwarde the sone of kynge Edward the fyrst.


OF this kyng Edward prophecyed Merlin & sayd y
•
 there sholde come a gote out of Carre y
t
 
shold
 haue hornes of syluer / & a berde as whyte as snowe / and a droppe shold come out of his nose∣thrylles y
t
 sholde betoken moche harme honger & dethe of people / & grece losse of his londe. And that in y
•
 begynnynge of his regne sholde be haūted moche leche∣ry. And he sayd sothe / alas the tyme for kyng Edward y
t
 was kyng Edwardes sone was borne at Carnaruan in Wales For sothe he had hornes of syluer and a berd as whyte as snowe whan he was made prȳce of Wales / to moche he gaue hym to ryot and to foly. And sothe sayd Merlyn in his {pro}phecy / that there 
shold
 come out of his nose a droppe. For in his tyme was grete honger among y
•
 poore people / & stronge dethe amonge y
•
 ty the that dyed in strange londe with sorowe & in warre in Scotlond. And afterward he lost Scotlonde & Gascoyn & moche le chery in his dayes was haūced. ¶ Also Merlyn sayd y
t
 this gote sholde seke the floure of lyfe & of deth. And he sayd so the for he spoused Isabell y
•
 kynges syster of Fraūce. And in this tyme Merlyn sayd that there shold be made brydges of folk vpon dyches of the see. And y
•
 was well seen at Bannockesbourne in Scotlonde whā he was discōtyted there of y
•
 Scot∣ces. And Merlyn tolde also that stones


sholde fall from castels / & many townes shold be made playne. And he sayd sothe For whan kynge Edward was discom¦fyted in Scotlonde & came than south∣warde / the Scottes besyeged castels & dyd moche harme / & brent townes vnto the harde erth. ¶ And afterward Mer∣lyn tolde that an egle sholde come out of Cornewayle that sholde haue fethers of golde / that of pryde sholde haue no pere / and he shold despyse lordes of blode / and after he shold dye through a bere at Ga∣uersyche / & that prophecy was full well knowen & foūde soche. For by the egle is vnderstande syr Pyers Ganaston / that than was erle of Cornewayle / whiche was a wonders proude man / & despised the barons of Englonde / but afterward he was heded at Gauersyche through y
e
 erle of Lancastre & the erle of warwyk. ¶ And Merlyn tolde that in this tyme it sholde seme that the bere sholde brenne and that batayle shold be vpon an arme of the see in a felde arayed lyke a shelde where sholde dye many whyte hedes / & he sayd sothe. For by the brennynge of y
e
 bere is betokened grete drede through cuttynge of swerdes at that batayle of Myton / for there came y
e
 Scottes in ma¦ner of a shelde in a wynge / & slewe men of religyon / preestes and seculers / wher fore the Scottes called that batayle in despyte of Englysshmen the whyte ba∣tayle. ¶ And after Merlin sayd that the foresayd Bere sholde do the Gote moche harme / & y
t
 sholde be vpon y
e
 south west / and also vpon his blode. And sayd also y
t
 the Gote shold lese moche dele of his lon∣de / tyll the tyme that shame sholde hym ouercome / & than he shold clothe hym in a lyons skynne / & sholde wynne agayne that he had lost / & more through people that sholde come out of the north west / y
t
 sholde make hym to be fered and hym a∣uenge vpon his enemyes through coun¦seyle of two owles / that fyrst 
shold
 be in peryl to be vndone. And those two owles sholde go ouer see in to a straūge londe / & there dwell a certayn tyme / & after shold returne agayn in to Englond / & shold do moche harme to many one / & that they sholde coūseyle y
e
 Gote to meue warre a∣gaynst the foresaid bere / & the gote & the owles sholde come to an arme of y
e
 see at Burton vpon Trent / & sholde go ouer / & that for drede the bere sholde flee with a swan in his cōpany to Bury towarde y
e
 north through an vnkynde outpulter / & that y
e
 swan thā shold be slayne w
t
 sorow and the bere 
shold
 be slayne full nye his owne nest / y
t
 shold stande vpon Poūtfret vpon whome the sonne sholde shede his bemes / & many folke shold seke hym for his vertue. And he sayd sothe. for y
e
 good erle Thomas of Lācastre was borne in the north west / & cosyn to y
e
 kynge & his vncles sone / & by lawe he made y
e
 kynge lese moche lōde y
t
 he had purchased wyl fully tyll at y
e
 last the kynge toke therof shame / & hymselfe fylled w
t
 cruelte. And after gate agayne y
t
 he had lost & moche more / through helpe of folk comyng out of y
e
 northwest / by whom he was drad / & auenged hȳ on his barons through coū¦seyle of y
e
 two Spēsers y
t
 afore were out lawed for theyr wickednes / & after came agayne out of Fraūce / & so moche these Spensers coūseyled y
e
 kynge y
t
 he 
shold
 warre vpon Thomas of Lancastre / so y
t
 the kyng & the Spensers and the erle of Arundell and theyr power mette with Thomas of Lancastre at Burton vpon Trent / and hym there discomfyted / and syr Vmfrey erle of Herford was in his company. And after fledde the foresayd Thomas and Vmfrey with theyr com∣pany to Burbrygge / metynge with syr Andrewe of Herkela / that is called y
e
 vn∣kynde outpulter / and also syr Symond Warde erle of Yorke they came & met w
t



Thomas of Lātastre w
t
 an huge compa¦ny / & them there discōsyted / & in y
•
 discō∣siture y
•
 crle of Herford was slayne vpon the brydge cowardly with a spere in the foūdement / & the erle Thomas was ta∣ken & ladde to Poūtfret / & than was he heded besyde his owne castell. But after¦ward many hym sought for myracles y
•
 god dyd for hym. And in y
•
 tyme Merlyn sayd / for sorowe and harme sholde dye a people of his londe / wherfore many lon¦des sholde be vpon hym the more bolder And he sayd sothe / for bycause of his ba∣rons that were put to deth for saȳt Tho¦mas quarell of Lancastre / people of ma∣ny londes became the bolder for to meue warre vpon theyr kyng / for theyr blode was turned to many nacyons. And af∣terward Merlyn tolde & sayd y
t
 the fore∣sayd owles sholde do moche harme vnto the floure of lyfe & deth / and they sholde brynge her to moche dysease / so that she sholde go ouer see in to Fraūce for to ma∣ke peas to y
•
 floure delyce / & there sholde abyde tyll on a tyme her sede shold come and seke her / and there they shold abyde bothe tyll y
•
 tyme that they sholde clothe them with grace / & those two owles she sholde seke & put them to pyteous deth. And that prophecy was well knowen / & was full sothe. For syr Hugh Spenser the fader & syr Hugh the sone did moche sorowe and persecucyon vnto the quene Isabell through theyr {pro}curemēt to her lord y
•
 kyng. So they ordeyned amonge them y
•
 she was put vnto her wages / y
•
 is to saye .xx. shillynges in y
•
 daye / wher fore the kyng of Frauce her broder was sore alwyed / & sent in to Englonde by his lettres vnto kynge Edward y
•
 he sholde come vnto his parlyament to Parys in Fraūce. But kynge Edwarde was sore adradde to come there / for he wende to haue be arested tyll that he had made a∣mendes for the trespace that syr Hugh Spenser the fader & the sone had done / & for y
•
 harme y
•
 they had done to the quene Isabell his syster. Wherfore through her ordynaūce & cōsent of y
•
 Spensers y
•
 quene Isabell went ouer see in to Frau∣ce for to make accorde bytwene kyng Ed¦warde & the kyng of Fraūce her broder. And there dwelled she in Fraūce tyll Ed¦ward her eldest sone came for to seke her and so they dwelled there bothe tyll that alyaūce was made bytwene them & the gentyl erle of Henaud / y
t
 yf they w
t
 theyr vertue myght destroye & ouercome y
•
 ves nym & the falsnes of the Spensers that syr Edward sholde spouse dame Philip the worshypfull lady & the erles dough∣ter of Henaud. Wherfore the quene Isa∣bell & Edward her sone / & syr Edmonde of wodstocke the kynges broder of Eng∣lond / & syr Iohn of Henaud / & syr Rogrt Mortimer of Wygmore / & syr Thomas Rocelyn / & syr Iohn of Cromwell / & syr Willyam Trussell / & many other of the alyaunce of the gentyll erle Thomas of Lancastre y
t
 were exiled out of Englōde for his quarel / & were disherued of theyr londes / ordeyned them a grete power & arryued at Herewich in Suffolke. And soone after they pursued the Spensers tyll y
t
 they were taken & put to pytcous deth / as before is said / & theyr company also / for y
•
 grete falsnes that they dyd to kynge Edward and to his people. And Merlyn sayd also more y
•
 the gote sholde be put to grete disrase & grete anguysshe & in grete soro wehe sholde lede his lyfe. And he sayd sothe / for after y
•
 tyme that kyng Edward was taken he was put in to warde tyll that y
•
 Spensers were put to deth / & also bycause he wolde not come to his parlyamēt at London as he had ordeyued & assygned hymselfe vnto his haronage / & also wolde not gouerne and rule his people nor his realme as a kynge sholde do. Wherfore some of y
•
 ba∣rons


of Englōde came & yelded vp theyr homages vnto hym for them and all the other of the realme on the daye of y
•
 con∣uersyon of saynt Paule / in y
•
 yere of his regne .xx. And they put hym out of his royalte for euermore / & euer he lyued af∣terward in moche sorowe & anguysshe.


LVdouicus was emperour after Henry .iiij. yere. This Lodewik was duke of Bauare / & he despysed the crownacyon of y
•
 pope / wherfore y
•
 pope deposed him / and moche labour & many peryls he had after / & he troubled gret∣ly the vnite of holy chirche. Than was chosen agaynst hym Frederyke duke of Austryche. And he ouercame the duke / & abode a rebellyon to his ende / & in grete peryll to his soule. And at the last Karo∣lus was chosen agaynst hym / the whi∣che preuayled / & sodeynly Lodewyk fell down of his hors and decessed. ¶ Iohn Maundeuyll a doctour of physyk and a knyght was borne in Englonde aboute this tyme. And he made a meruaylous pylgrymage / for he went almoost about all y

 worlde / & he wrote his dedes in thre languages / & decessed & was buryed at saynt Albons. ¶ Benedictus the .xxij. was pope after Iohn .vij. yere & more. This man was a monke / and in all his youth he was of good cōuersacyon / and a doctour of diuinite. And whā he was made pope he reformed y

 ordre of saynt Benet in that thynge y

 was necessary. And he was an harde man to graunte benefyces / leest he had graunted it to an vnconnynge man. He made a decretall y

 whiche began Benedictus de{us} in donis suis. And he was very cruell ī his fayth And for y

 of some men was lytell loued. He was so stoute a man that almoost he wolde not knowe his owne cosyns.

¶ Of kynge Edwarde the thyrde after the conquest.




AFter this kyng Edward of Car∣naruan regned syr Edwarde of Wyndsore his sone / y
•
 whiche was crow¦ned kynge & anoynted at Westmynster / through coūseyle & consent of all y
•
 grete lordes of y
•
 realme y
•
 sondaye on Candel∣masse euen / in y
•
 yere of grace. M .CCC .xxvj. that was of age at y

 tyme but .xv. yere. And for bycause y
•
 his fader was in¦warde in the castel of Kenilworth & also was put downe of his royalte / y
•
 realme of Englonde was without kyng from y
•
 feest of saint Katherin in the yere aboue sayd vnto the feest of Candelmasse. And than were all maner plees of y

 kynges benche astent. And than was cōmaun∣ded to all y

 sheryues of Englōd through wrytte to warne y

 partyes to defendaū¦tes through somnynge agayn. And also ferthermore y
•
 al prisoners y

 were in the kȳges gayles y
•
 were attached through sheryues / shold be let go quyte. ¶ Kyng Edwarde after his crownacyon at the prayer & besechynge of his lyege men of the realme graūted thē a chartre of sted∣fast peas to all them y
•
 wold aske it. And syr Iohn of Henaud & his company toke theyr leue of the kyng & of y
•
 lordes of the realme / & turned home to theyr own coū¦tre agayn / & eche of them had full ryche gyftes / euery man as he was of value & of estate. And than was Englond in rest & peas / & grete loue bytwene the kyng & his lordes. And comynly Englysshmen sayd amōge them y
•
 the deuyl was deed But the innumerable tresour of y
•
 kyng his fader / & the tresour of the Spensers bothe of the fader & of y

 erle of Arundell / & of mayster Robert Baldoc y
•
 was y
•
 kynges chaūceler was departed after y

 quene Isabelles ordynaūce & syr Roger Mortimers of wygmore / so that


the kynge had no thynge therof / but at her wyll & her delyueraūce / nor of theyr londes / as afterwarde ye shall here.






¶ How kyng Edward went to Stan∣hope for to mete the Scottes.


ANd yet in y
•
 same tyme was the kyng in the castel of Kenilworth vnder y
•
 kepynge of syr Henry that was erle Thomas broder of Lācastre y
•
 than was erle of Leycestre / & the kyng graū∣ted hym y
•
 erledom of Lancastre / that y
•
 kyng his fader had seased ī to his hādes & put out Thomas of Lancastre his bro¦der. And so was he erle of Lancastre & of Leycestre / & also steward of Englōde as his broder was in his tyme. But syr Ed¦ward that was kyng Edwardes fader made sorowe w
t
out ende / for bycause he myght not speke w
t
 his wyfe nor w
t
 his sōne / wherfore he was ī moche mischefe For though it were so y
•
 he was lad & ru∣led by fals coūseyle / yet was he king Ed¦wardes sone called Edward w
t
 the longe shankes / & came out of y
•
 worthiest blode of all y
•
 worlde / & they to whom he was wont to gyue grete gyftes & large / were moost preuy w
t
 the kyng his sone / & they were his enemyes bothe by nyght & by daye y
•
 {pro}cured to make debate & contake bytwene hym & his sone and Isabel his wyfe. But y
•
 frere prechers were to him good frendes euermore / & cast bothe by nyght & by day how they myght brynge hym out of prison. And amonge theyr cō¦pany y
•
 the freres had pryuely brought there was a frere y
•
 called Dunhened / & he had ordeyned & gadred a grete compa¦ny of folke to kepe at y
•
 nede / but y
•
 frere was takē & put in y
•
 castell of Poūfret / & there he dyed in pryson / & syr Henry erle of Lancastre that had y
•
 kynges fader in kepyng through cōmaundement of the kynge delyuered Edward y
•
 kynges fa∣der by endenture to syr Thomas of Ber∣keley / & so syr Iohn Mautreuers & they led him from y
•
 castel of Kenilworth to y
•
 castell of Berkley / & kept hȳ there safely And at cester next after his crownacyon the kynge ordeyned an huge hoost for to fyght agaynst y
•
 Scottes. And syr Iohn the erles broder of Henaud came frō be∣yonde y
•
 see for to helpe kyng Edward / & brought w
t
 hym. vij .C. men of armes / & arryued at Douer / & they had leue for to go forth tyl they came to yorke where as the king them abode / & y
•
 Scottes came thyder to y
•
 kynge for to make peas & ac∣corde / but the accordement lasted not by∣twene them but a lytell tyme. And at y
•
 tyme the Englysshmen were clothed all in cotes & hodes peynted with 
 & with floures full semely w
t
 lōge berdes / & therfore the Scottes made a byll that was fastened vpon the chirche dores of saynt Peters towarde stengace / & thus sayd y
•
 scripture in despyte of Englysshe¦men. ¶ Longe berdes bertles / peyn∣ted hodes wytles / gaye cotes graceles / maketh Englonde thryftles.


ON Trinite sondaye nexte after be∣gan the cōtake in the cite of Yorke bytwene the Englysshmen and the He∣naudes / & in that debate were slayne of the erledom of Nycholl & murdred. 
. men / & after they were buryed vnder a stone in saynt Clementes chirche in 
∣gate. And bycause y
•
 the Henaudes came to helpe the king / theyr peas was cryed vpon payne of lyfe & lymme & in y
•
 other halfe it was foūde by an enquest of y
•
 cite that the Englysshmen began y
•
 debate.






¶ How y
•
 Englysshmen stopped y
•
 Scot¦tes in y
•
 parke of Stanhope / & how they returned agayne into Scotlonde.


ANd at y
•
 tyme y
•
 Scottes had as∣sembled all theyr power & came in to Englōde & slewe & robbed all y
•
 they myght take / & also brente & destroyed all


the north coūtree throughout tyll y
•
 they came to the parke of Stanhope in wyre dale / & there y
•
 Scottes helde them in a busshmēt. But whan y
•
 kyng had herde through certayn spyes where y
•
 scottes were / anone right w
t
 his hoost besyeged them within y
•
 foresayd parke / so that y
•
 Scottes wyst not where to go out / but onely to theyr harmes / & they abode in y
•
 parke .xv. days / & vytayles fayled them on euery syde / so y
•
 they were gretly ap∣payred of theyr bodyes. And syth y
•
 Bru¦te came fyrst in to Brytayn to this tyme there was neuer seen soo fayre an hoost what of Englysshmen & of alyens & of men on fote / the whiche ordeyned them for to fyght with the Scottes / through eggyng of syr Henry of Lācastre & of syr Iohn of Henaud y
•
 wold haue gone ouer the water of wyth for to haue fought w
t
 the Scottes. But syr Roger Mortymer consented not therto / for he had pryuely takē mede of the Scottes to helpe them that they myght go in to theyr countre. And this Mortimer coūseyled so moche Thomas of Brotherton y
•
 erle Marshall that was kyng Edwardes vncle that y
•
 foresaid Thomas sholde not assemble at that tyme vnto y
•
 Scottes / & he assented but he wyst not the doynge bytwene the Scottes & the foresayd Mortimer. And bycause y
•
 he was Marshall of Englōde & to hym perteyned euer y
•
 vaūtwarde / he sent hastely to y
•
 erle of Lancastre & to syr Iohn of Henaud that they 
shold
 not fyght with the Scottes / in preiudyce & harmyng of hym & his fee / & yf they did that they sholde stande to theyr owne pe¦ryll. And y
•
 foresayd erle Marshall was al arayed w
t
 his batayle at y
•
 reredoos of the erle of Lācastre for to haue fought w
t
 hym & w
t
 his folke / yf he had meued for to fyght w
t
 the Scottes. And in this ma¦ner he was deceyued / & wyst nothynge of the treason. And thus was the kyng principally deceyued. And whan it was nyght Mortymer that had the watche for to kepe of the hoost y
•
 nyght / dystrou∣bled y
•
 watche that nothynge myght be done. And in y
•
 meane whyle y
•
 Scottes stole by nyght toward theyr owne coun∣tree as fast as they myght. And so was the kynge falsly betrayed / that wende y
•
 all the traytours of his londe had ben brought to an ende as it was said before Now here ye lordes how traytoursly y
•
 kyng Edward was deceyued / and how meruaylously & boldly the Scottes dyd of warre. For Iames Douglas w
t
 two hondred men of armes rode throughout all the hoost of kyng Edward / the same nyght y
•
 Scottes escaped toward theyr owne coūtre as is aboue sayd tyll y
•
 they came to y
•
 kynges pauylyon / and slewe there many men ī theyr beddes / & cryed naward naward / & an other tyme a dou¦glas a douglas. Wherfore y
•
 kyng that was in his pauilyon & moche other folk were wonders sore afrayde. But blissed be god y
•
 kyng was not taken / & in grete peryll was than y
•
 realme of Englonde. And y
•
 nyght the mone shone full clere & bryght. And for all the kynges men the Scottes escaped harmeles. And on the morowe whan the kyng wyst that the Scottes were escaped in to theyr owne coūtre / he was wōders sory / & full herte¦ly wepte w
t
 his yonge eyen / & yet wyst he not who had done hym y
•
 treason / but that fals treason was full well knowen a good whyle after as the story telleth. Than kynge Edwarde came agayne to yorke full sorowfull / & his hoost depar∣ted / and euery man went in to his owne coūtree with full heuy chere and mour∣nynge semblaunt / & the Henaudes toke theyr leue & went in to theyr owne coun¦tre / & the king for theyr trauayle hugely rewarded them. And for bycause of that vyage the kynge had dyspended moche


of his tresour & wasted. ¶ And in that tyme were seen two mones in y
•
 fyrma∣ment / that one was clere and that other was derke / as men myght se through y
•
 worlde. And a grete debate was y
•
 same tyme agaynst pope Iohn the .xxij. after saynt Peter / & the emperour of Almayn tho made hym emperour agaynst y
•
 po∣pes wyll / y
•
 tho helde his see at Auinyon Wherfore y
•
 emperour made his crye at Rome & ordeyned an other pope y
•
 hyght Nicholas y
•
 was a frere Minour / & that was agaynst the ryght of holy chirche / wherfore he was cursed / & the power of that other pope soone was layd. And by¦cause y
•
 suche meruayles were seen: men sayd y
•
 the worlde was nygh at an ende.






¶ Of the deth of kynge Edwarde of Carnaruan.


ANd now go we agayn to syr Ed∣ward of Carnaruan y
•
 was king Edwardes fader somtyme kyng of Eng¦londe / & was put downe of his dignite. Alas for his tribulacion & sorowe y
•
 hym befell through fals coūseyle y
•
 he loued & trusted vpon to moche / that afterwarde were destroyed through theyr falsnesse as god wold. And this Edward of Car∣naruan was in y
•
 castell of Berkeley / vn¦der y
•
 kepyng of syr Moryce of Berkeley and syr Iohn of Mautreuers / & to them he made his cōplaynt of his sorowe & of his disease. And ofte tymes asked of his wardeyns what he hadde trespaced a∣gaynst dame Isabell his wyfe & syr Ed¦ward his sone y
•
 was made newe kyng that they wold not visyte hym. And thā answered one of his wardeyns & sayd. My worthy lorde dysplease you not y
•
 I shall tell you / the cause is / for it is done them to vnderstande / y
•
 yf my lady your wyfe come ony thynge nye you / that ye wolde her strangle & slee / & also that ye wolde do to my lorde your sone y
•
 same. Than answered he with a symple chere Alas alas am not I in prison / and all at your owne wyll / now god it wote I ne∣uer thought it / & now I wolde y
•
 I were deed / so wolde to god y
•
 I were / for than were all my sorowe passed. It was not longe after y
•
 the kyng through coūseyle of Roger Mortymer graūted y
•
 warde & kepynge of syr Edward his fader to syr Thomas Toiourney / & to y
•
 foresayd syr Iohn Mautreuers through the kinges lettre / & put out holly y
•
 foresayd syr Mo∣ryce of the warde of the kyng. And they toke & lad the kyng to y
•
 castell of Corf▪ y
•
 whiche castel y
•
 kyng hated as ony deth. And they kept hym there tyll it came vn to saynt Mathewes day in September in the yere of grace. M .CCC .xxvii. that the foresayd syr Roger Mortimer sent y
•
 maner of y
•
 deth / how & in what wyse he shold be put to deth. And anone as y
•
 fore¦sayd Thomas & Iohn had seen y
•
 
 & cōmaūdement / they made kynge Ed∣warde of Carnaruan good chere & good solace as they might at y
•
 souper / and no thynge the kyng wyst of y
•
 treason. And whan tyme was for to go to bedde the kynge wente vnto his bedde & laye and slepte fast. And as the kyng laye & slepte the traytoures false for sworne agaynst theyr homage & feaute came pryuely in to y
•
 kynges chambre / & theyr company with them / & layde an huge table vpon his wombe / & with men pressed & helde fast down the foure corners of y
•
 table on his body / wherwith y
•
 good man awoke and was wonders sore adrad to be deed there & slayne / & turned his body tho vp so downe. Than toke y
•
 fals traytours & tyraūtes an horne & put it in to his foun¦dement as depe as they myght / & toke a spyt of coper brēnynge / & put it through the horne in to his body / and ofte tymes therwith thyrled his bowelles / & so they


slewe theyr lord that nothynge was per¦ceyued / & was buryed at Glocestre.






¶ How kynge Edward spoused Philip the erles doughter of Henaud at Yorke.


ANd after Chrystmasse than next folowynge syr Iohn of Henaud brought with hym Philip his broders doughter y
t
 was erle of Henaud his nece in to Englond / & kyng Edward spoused her at Yorke w
t
 moche honour. And syr Iohn of Bothum bisshop of Ely and syr William of Melton archebysshop of yor¦ke sange the masse y
e
 sonday on y
e
 euen of the cōuersion of saint Paule / in y
e
 yere of grace. M .CCC .xxvij. But bycause that the kynge was yonge and tender of age whan he was crowned / full many wron¦ges were done whyle y
t
 his fader lyued bycause y
t
 he byleued the coūseylers that were fals aboute hym to do otherwyse than reason wolde / wherfore grete har∣me was done to y
e
 realme & to y
e
 kyng / & all men directed it to y
e
 kynges dede / & it was not so / almyghty god it knoweth. Wherfore it was ordeyned at y
e
 kynges crownyng y
t
 the kyng for his tender age sholde be gouerned by .xij. of the gretest lordes of Englonde / without whome no thynge shold be done / that is to saye / the archebysshop of Caūterbury / the arche∣bisshop of yorke / the bisshop of wynche∣stre / & the bysshop of Herford / the erle of Lancastre / the erle Marshall / & y
e
 erle of Kent y
t
 were y
e
 kynges vncles / & the erle of Garen / syr Thomas wake / syr Henry Percy / syr Olyuer of yngham / & Iohn of Roos barons. All these were sworne truly for to coūseyle y
e
 kyng / & they shold answere euery yere in y
e
 parlyamēt of y
t
 that sholde be done in the tyme of theyr gouernall. But y
e
 ordynaūce was soone vndone / & that was moche harme to all Englōde. For the kyng & all the lordes y
e
 
shold
 gouerne hym were gouerned and ruled after the kȳges moder dame Isa∣bell / & by syr Roger Mortimer. And as they wolde all thynge was done / bothe amonge hye & lowe. And they toke vnto them castels / townes / londes / & rentes / in grete harme & losse to the crowne / & of the kynges estate out of mesure.






¶ How the peas was made bytwene y
e
 Englisshmen & the Scottes / and also of iustyfyenge of Troylebaston.


BYnge Edwarde at whytsontyde in the seconde yere of his regne / through the coūseyle of his moder & syr Roger Mortimer ordeyned a parlyamēt at Northamton. And at that parlyamēt the kyng through theyr coūseyle / & none other of the londe within age graunted to be accorded with the Scottes in this maner. That all the feautees and homa¦ges that the Scottes sholde do vnto the crowne of Englonde forgaue them for euer more by his chartre ensealed. And forthermore an endenture was made of the Scottes vnto kynge Edwarde that was kyng Henryes sone / whiche enden¦ture they called ragman / in the whiche were cōteyned al y
e
 homages & feautees Fyrst of the kynge of Scotlonde & of all the prelates / erles & barons of y
e
 realme of Scotlonde / w
t
 theyr seales set theron / and other chartres & remembraunces y
t
 kynge Edwarde and his barons had of theyr right in y
e
 foresayd realme of Scot¦lond / it was forgyuen them agaynst ho¦ly chirche. And also with y
e
 blacke crosse of Scotlonde / the whiche y
e
 good kynge Edwarde conquered in Scotlonde / and brought it out of the abbey of Scone / y
t
 is a full precyous relyke. And also for∣thermore he relesed & forgaue all the lon¦des that the barons of Englonde had in Scotlonde by olde conquest. ¶ And this peas for to be hold and last the Scottes were bounde vnto the kyng in .xxx. M.


poūde of syluer to be payed within thre yere / that is euery yere .x. M. poūde by euen porcyons. And forthermore aboue all this they spake bytwene the partyes aboue sayd / that Dauyd Dritonautier that was kynge Robert the Brus sone y
e
 fals tyraunt & fals forsworne agaynst his othe y
t
 arose agaynst his lyege lorde the noble and good kyng Edward / and falsly made him kyng of Scotlōde / that was of y
e
 age of .v. yere. And so through this cursed counseyle Dauid spoused at Barwyk dame Ione of the toure / that was kynge Edwardes syster / as y
e
 gest telleth vpon Mary Magdaleyns daye / in y
e
 yere of grace. M .CCC. and .xxviij. to grete harme & empayrynge of all the kynges blode / wherof that gentyll lady came / alas y
e
 tyme / for wonders moche was that fayre damoysell desparaged syth that she was maryed agaynst all the comyns assent of Englonde. And fro the tyme that Brute had conquered Al∣bion / & named the londe after his owne name Brytayn / that now is called Eng¦londe / after the name of Engyst / and so the realme of Scotlonde was holden of the realme of Englonde / & of the crowne by feaute & homage. For Brute conque∣red that londe / and gaue it to Albanack that was his seconde sone / and he called that londe Albayn after his own name / so that the heyres that came after hym sholde holde of Brute and of his heyres / that is to saye of y
e
 kynges of Brytayne by feaute & homage. And frō that tyme vnto this tyme of kynge Edwarde / the realme of Scotlonde was holden of the realme of Englonde by feaute & seruyce as aboue is sayd in y
e
 Cronycles of Eng¦londe & of Scotlonde / and bereth wyt∣nes more plenarly. ¶ And cursed be the tyme that this parliament was holden at Northamton. For there through fals coūseyle the kyng was there falsly dys∣heryted / & yet he was within age. And yet whan that kyng Edward was put out of his royalte of Englonde / yet men put not hym out of y
e
 feautees & seruyce of Scotlonde / ne of the fraūchyses dys∣heryted hym for euermore. And neuer∣theles the grete lordes of Englōde were agaynst to confyrme y
e
 peas & the trewse aboue sayd / saue onely quene Isabell y
t
 was the kynges moder Edwarde / and the bysshop of Ely / and the lorde Mont∣mer. But reason & lawe wolde not y
t
 a fy¦nall peas sholde be made bytwene them without the comyn assent of Englonde.






¶ Of the debate y
t
 was bytwene quene Isabell & syr Henry erle of Lācastre & of Leycestre / & of the rydynge of Bedford.


WHan y
e
 foresayd Dauid had spou∣sed dame Ione of the toure in the towne of Barwik (as before is sayd) the Scottes in despyte of the Englysshmen called dame Ione y
e
 coūtesse make peas for the cowardly peas that was ordey∣ned. But the kynges persone bare al the wyte & blame with wronge of the ma∣kynge of the accorde. And all was done through the quene & Roger M
rtymer. And it was not longe after that y
e
 quene Isabell ne toke in to her handes all the lordshyp of Pountfret almoost all y
e
 lon∣des that were of ony value that apper∣teyned to the crowne of Englonde. So y
t
 the kynge had not for to dyspende but of his vses & of his excheker. For the quene Isabell & Mortimer had a gre
e meyny of theyr retynue that folowed euermore the kynges courte / & went & toke y
e
 kyn∣ges pryces for her peny worthes at good chepe. Wherfore the coūtre y
t
 they came in / were full sore adrad and almoost de∣stroyed of them. Thā began y
e
 cominalte of Englonde for to haue enuy to Isabell the quene that so moche loued her before


whan she came agayne fro Fraūce for to pursue the fals traytours y
e
 Spensers. And in that same tyme y
e
 false traytour Robert of Holand that be
rayed his lord syr Thomas of Lancastre / was than de¦lyuered out of pryson / & was wonders preuy with y
e
 quene Isabell & also with Roger Mortimer. But that auayled hȳ but lytell / for he was taken at Myghel∣masse next folowyng as he rode toward the quene Isabell to London / & syr Tho¦mas wyther smote of his heed besydes the towne of saynt Albons. And this syr Thomas dwelled with syr Henry erle of Lancastre / & he put hym asyde for drede of the quene / for she loued hym wonders moche / & prayed vnto y
e
 kyng for hym y
t
 the same Thomas myght be exiled out of Englonde. And y
e
 noble erle syr Henry of Lancastre had oftentymes herde the comyn damour of y
e
 Englysshmen / of y
t
 disease that was done in Englonde / & al¦so for dyuers wronges y
t
 were done to y
e
 comyn people. Of the whiche the kyng bare the blame w
t
 wronge. For he was yonge & tender of age. And thought as a good man for to do awaye and slake the sclaundre of y
e
 kynges person / yf that he myght in ony maner wyse / so as y
e
 kyng was therof nothynge gylty / wherfore he was in peryll of his lyfe. And so he assembled all his retenaunces & went & spake w
t
 them of y
e
 kynges honour / & al∣so for to amende his estate. And syr Tho¦mas Brotherton erle Marshall / and syr Edmond of wodstok y
t
 were the kynges vncles / & also men of Londō made theyr othe for to maynteyn hym in that same quarell. And theyr cause was this / that the kyng sholde holde his hous and his meyny as a king ought to do / & haue all his ryalte / & that y
e
 quene Isabell 
shold
 deliuer out of her handes in to y
e
 kynges handes all maner lordshyppes / rentes / townes & castels y
t
 apperteyned vnto y
e
 crowne of Englōde as other quenes dyd before her / and meddle with none other thynge. And also that syr Roger Morti∣mer 
shold
 abyde & dwell vpon his owne londes / for y
e
 whiche londes he had hol∣pen to disheryte moche people / in so mo∣che that y
e
 comyn people were destroyed through wrongfull takynge. And also to enquyre how & by whome the kynge was betrayed & falsly deceiued at Stan hope / and through whose coūseyle that the Scottes went away by nyght from the kynge. And also how and through whose coūseyle y
e
 ordynaunce that was made at the kynges crownacyon was put downe / that is for to saye / that the kynge for amendement and helpyng of the realme / and in honour of hym sholde be gouerned and ruled by .xij. of the gre∣test and wisest lordes of the realme / and without them sholde nothynge be graū¦ted ne done (as before is sayd) the whi∣che couenauntes were malycyously put downe from the kynge / wherfore many harmes shames & reproues haue fallen to the kyng and his realme. And that is to vnderstand for as moche as Edward somtyme kyng of Englonde was ordey¦ned by assent of the comynalte in playne parlyament for to be vnder the warde & gouernaunce of Henry erle of Lancastre his cosyn for saluacyon of his body / he was taken out of y
e
 castel of Ken
worth where he was in warde / & through co∣lour of quene Isabell & of Mortimer w
t
∣out cōsent of ony parliament they toke & lad hȳ where as neuer after none of his 
ynrede myght speke w
t
 hȳ / & after tray toursly murdred hym / for whose deth a∣rose a sclaundre through all christendom whan it was done. And also y
e
 tresour y
t
 syr Edward of Carnaruan left in many places 
 englōd & in wales was wasted & borne awaye without y
e
 wyll of kyng Edward his sone / in destruccion of hym


and all his folke. ¶ Also through whose coūseyle that the kyng gaue vp y
e
 kyng∣dom of Scotlonde / for y
e
 whiche realme the kynges auncesters had full sore tra∣uayled / and so dyd many a noble mā for theyr ryght / & was delyuered to Dauid that was Robert y
e
 Brus sone al y
e
 right that no ryght had to y

 realme / as al the worlde it wyst. ¶ And also by whome y
e
 charters & remembraūces y

ame Ione of y
e
 toure kyng Edwardes syster was disparaged & maryed to Da¦uid y
t
 was Robert y
e
 Brus sone / y
t
 was a traytour & enemy to Englōd / & through whose coūseyle she was taken in to our enemyes handes out of Englōde. ¶ And in the meane whyle the good erle Henry of Lancastre & his cōpany toke coūseyle how these poyntes aboue said might be amended to y
e
 worship of y
e
 king & to his profyte / & to y
e

 kynges broder was gyrt with a swerde of Cornewayle / & tho was called erle of Cornewayl. And euermore quene Isabell {pro}cured so moche anenst her sone the king / y
t
 she had y

e
 erle of Lancastre wold not come / but ordeyned his power agaynst quene Isabell & Mortymer / and men of London ordeyned them with .v .C. men of armes. Whan quene Isabell wyst of the doynge / she swore by god & by his na¦mes full angerly / that in an euyll tyme he thought vpon those poyntes. Than sent the quene Isabell & Mort

e
 kynges retynue so that they had ordeyned amōge them an huge hoost. And they so coūseyled the kyng / that vpon a nyght they rode. xxiij myle towarde Bedford / where as y
e
 erle of Lancastre was with his company & thought to haue destroyed hym / & that nyght she rode besyde the kyng her sone as a knight armed for drede of deth. And it was done the kynge to vnderstande y
e
 the erle Henry of Lācastre & his compa∣ny wolde haue destroyed the kyng & his coūseyle for euermore / wherfore y
e
 kyng was somdele towardes hym heuy and anoyed. ¶ Whan y

ode so in message bytwene them / that the kyng graunted hym his peas to the erle Henry of Lan∣castre for a certayne raunsom of. x

¶ How kynge Edwarde went ouer the see for to do his homage to the kynge of Fraunce for the duchy of Guyen.


IT was not longe after y
e
 the kyng of Fraūce through coūseyle of his Douzepers sent vnto kynge Edward of


Englonde that he sholde come to Parys and do his homage (as reason it wolde) for y
•
 duchy of Guyen / & so through coū∣seyle of y

 lordes of Englonde kynge Ed∣ward went ouer y
•
 see / & at y
•
 Ascencyon tyde he came to Parys the thyrd yere of his regne for to do his homage vnto the kyng of Fraūce. And the kyng receyued his homage / & made of hym moche ioye & worship. But whā kyng Edward had done his homage / hastely he was sente for in to Englonde through y

 quene Isa¦bell his moder / & anone hastely he came agayn in to Englond vpon whytsonday w
t
out takynge leue of y

 kyng of Fraūce / wherfore he was wonders wroth.






¶ How syr Roger Mortimer bare hym proudly and wonders hye.


ANd now shall ye here of syr Ro∣ger Mortimer of wygmore that desyred & coueyted to be at an hye estate so that y
•
 kyng graūted hym to be called erle of Marche / throughout all his lord∣shyp. And he became so proude & so hau∣teyn y
•
 he wold lese & forsake the name y
•
 his elders had euer before / & for y
•
 cause he let call hym erle of Marche / and none of the comyns of Englonde durst call hȳ by other name. For he was called so by the kynges crye / y
•
 men sholde call hym erle of Marche. And Mortimer bare hȳ so hauteyne & so proude / that wonder it was for to wyte / & also dysguysed hym with wonders ryche clothes out of all maner of reason / bothe of shapynge & of werynge. Wherof y
•
 Englysshmen had grete wonder / how & in what maner he myght contryue or fynde suche maner pride / & they sayd amōge them comynly that his pryde sholde not longe endure. And y
•
 same tyme sir Geffrey Mortimer that was Mortimers sone let call hym kyng of foly / & so it befell afterwarde in dede. For he was so full of pryde and of wretchednes / that he held a roūde table in Wales to all men that came thyder / & coūterfeyted the doynge & the maner of kyng Arthurs table / but openly he fay∣led. For the noble kyng Arthur was the moost noble lorde of renome y
•
 was in all the world in his tyme / & yet came neuer none suche after / for al y
•
 noble knyghtes in all chrystendom of dedes of armes as∣sayed dwellyng w
t
 kyng Arthur / & helde hym for theyr lord & souerayn. And that was well seen / for he conquered in ba∣tayle a Romayn that was called Froll / and gate of hym the realme of Fraūce / & slewe hym w
t
 his own handes. And also he faught with a gyaunt y
•
 was called Dinabus & slewe hym / y
•
 had rauysshed fayre Eleyn that was kynge Howelles nece kynge of lytell Brytayn. And after he slewe in batayle y
•
 emperour of Rome that was called Lucie / that had assem∣bled agaynst kynge Arthur for to fyght with hym so moche people of Romayns & Phethis & sarasyns / y
•
 no man coude nombre them / & he discomfited them all as y
•
 story telleth. ¶ And in y
•
 same tyme the comyn voyce spronge in Englonde through coniectynge & ordynaūce of the frere prechers / that syr Edward of Car naruan / that was kyng Edwardes fa∣der / of whome the gest telleth / sayd y
•
 he was alyue in y
•
 castell of Corf / wherfore al y
•
 comyns of Englōde almoost were in sorowe & drede whether it were so or not For they wyst not how traytoursly Mor¦timer had done hym to be murdred.






¶ How Edmond of wodstok y
•
 was erle of Kent & the kynges broder Edward of Carnaruan was heded at Wynchestre.


ANd on a certayne tyme it befell so that syr Edmond of wodstock erle of Kent spake vnto the pope Iohn


the .xxij. at Auinyon & sayd y
•
 almyghty god had often tymes done for Thomas lone of Laneastre many grete myracles to many men & women / y
•
 were through dyuerse maladyes vndone (as vnto the worlde) & through his prayer they were brought to theyr helth / & so syr Edmond prayed y
•
 pope hertely y
•
 he wolde graūt hȳ grace y
•
 the foresayd Thomas might be translated. But y
•
 pope sayd nay / that he 
shold
 not be translated vnto the tyme he were better certyfyed of the clergy of Englonde and seen by theyr obedyence what thynge god had done for y
•
 loue of saynt Thomas of Lancastre after y
•
 sug¦gestyon that y
•
 foresayd erle of Kent had made to hym. And whan this Edmond saw y
•
 he might not spede of his purpose as touchyng the translacyon / he prayed hȳ of coūseyle as touchyng syr Edward of Carnaruan his broder / & sayd not lon¦ge ago he was king of Englonde / what thynge myght best be done as touching his deliueraūce / syth y
•
 a comyn fame is through Englonde y
•
 he is alyue & safe. Whan the pope herde hym tell y
•
 syr Ed∣ward was alyue / he cōmaūded the erle vpon his benyson y
•
 he sholde helpe w
t
 all the power y
•
 he myght y
•
 he were delyue∣red out of prison / & saue his body in all y
•
 he myght / & to brynge this thynge to an ende he assoyled hym & his cōpany (a pe na et culpa) & al tho y
•
 holpe to his deliue¦raunce. Than toke Edmond of wodstok his leue of the pope & came agayne in to Englonde. And whan syr Edmond was comen / some of y
•
 frere prechers came & sayd y
•
 syr Edwarde his broder yet was alyue in y
•
 castell of Corf / vnder y
•
 keping of syr Thomas Gurney. Tho sped hym the foresayd Edmōd as fast as he might tyll he came to y
•
 castel of Corf / & aqueyn¦ted hym and spake so fayre with Iohn Daueryll / that was constable of y
•
 same castell / & gaue him ryche gyftes to haue acqueyntaunce of hym & to knowe of his coūseyle. And thus it befel y
•
 the foresayd syr Edmond prayed specially to tell hym pryuely of his lorde his broder syr Ed∣ward / yf y
•
 he lyued or were deed / & yf he were alyue he prayed hȳ ones to haue a syght of hym. And this syr Iohn Daue¦ryll was a hye herted man & full of cou∣rage / & answered shortly to syr Edmond & sayd / that syr Edward his broder was in helth & vnder his kepyng / & durst not shewe hym to no man syth it was defen∣ded hȳ in y
•
 kynges half Edward y
•
 was Edwardes sone of Carnaruan / & also by the cōmaūdemēt of quene Isabell y
•
 kyn¦ges moder / & of syr Roger Mortymer / y
•
 he shold shewe his body to no man of the world / saue onely to them vpō lyf & lȳme & disheryting of his heyres for euermore But the fals traytour falsly lyed / for he was not in his warde / but he was takē thens & lad to y
•
 castell of Berkeley by syr Thomas Gurney / by cōmaūdement of Mortimer tyll he was deed as before is sayd / but syr Edmōd of wodstok wyst no thynge y
•
 syr Edwarde his broder was deed / whervpon he toke a lettre to kyng Edward his broder as to his worthy lor¦de. And receyued y
•
 lettre of hȳ & behight hym to do his message w
t
out ony fayle. And with y
•
 syr Edmond toke leue of the foresayd Iohn & went in to his own coū¦tre & lordshyp ī Kent y
•
 he had there. And anone as this same Iohn wyst y
•
 syr Ed¦mond was gone in to Kent his own lord¦ship / he went in all the haste y
•
 be might fro the castel of Corf & came to syr Roger Mortimer / & toke hym y
•
 lettre y
•
 syr Ed∣mond of wodstok erle of Kent had taken hym closed & ensealed w
t
 his owne seale. And whan syr Roger Mortimer had re∣ceyued the lettre / he vnclosed it & sawe what was conteyned therin / & began to rede it / wherof y
•
 begȳnynge was this. ¶ Worshyps & reuerence with broders


legeaunce and subie
cyon. Syr knyght worshipful & dere broder / yf it please you I praye you hertely y
•
 ye be in good com forte / for I shall so ordeyne for you / that ye shall come out of prison & be deliuered of that disease that ye be in. And vnder∣stande of your grete lordshyp y

 I haue to myne assentyng almoost all the grete lordes of Englonde with all theyr appa¦rayle / y

Whan syr Roger Mortimer sawe & vnderstode the myght & the strengthe of the lettre / anone his herte for wrath began to boll & euyll hert bare toward syr Edmond of wodstok y
•
 was erle of Kent / & w
t
 all the haste that he might he went vnto dame Isabell y
•
 quene y
•
 was y
•
 kynges moder & shewed her syr Edmondes lettre / his wyll & his purpose / & how that he had coniected & ordeyned to put downe kyng Edward of wyndsore her sone of his ry∣alte & of his kyngdom. Now certes syr Roger sayd she / hath syr Edmōd done so now by my faders soule sayd she I wyll be therof auenged / yf that god graūt me lyfe / & that in a shorte tyme. And with y
•
 the quene Isabel went to king Edward her sone there as he was at the parlya∣ment at Wynchestre for to amende the wronges & the trespaces that were done amonge the people of his realme / & she toke and shewed hym the lettre that syr Edmond of wodstock had made and en∣sealed with his owne seale / and badde hym vpon her blessynge that he sholde be auenged vpon syr Edmonde as vpon his deedly enemy. Than was the quene sore wroth towarde syr Edmonde erle of Kent / and cessed neuer to praye vnto her sone tyll that he had sent in all the haste after hym. And vpon that the kyng sent by his lettres after syr Edmond of wod∣stok / that he sholde come & speke w
t
 hym at Wynchestre all maner thynges lefte. And whan syr Edmond sawe y
•
 the king sent after hym with his lettres ensealed he hasted hym in all that he myght tyll that he came to wynchestre. But whan the quene wyst that syr Edmonde was comen to wynchestre / anone she went & prayed so fast vnto kynge Edwarde her sone that y
•
 good erle was arested anone and ladde vnto y
•
 barre before Robert of Hamond y
•
 was Crowner of the kynges housholde / & he assocyed to hym syr Ro∣ger Mortimer. And than spake the fore sayd Robert & said. Syr Edmond erle of Kent / ye shall vnderstāde that it is done vs to wyte / & prȳcypally vnto our lyege lorde the kynge Edwarde of Englonde almyghty god hym saue & kepe / that ye be his deedly enemy & a traytour / & also a comyn enemy vnto the realme / & that ye haue ben aboute many a daye for to make preuy delyueraūce of syr Edward somtyme king of Englonde your broder the whiche somtyme was put downe of his royalte by y
•
 comyn assent of y
•
 lordes of Englonde in appeasynge of our lorde the kynges estate / & also of his realme. Than answered the good man & sayd. Forsothe syr vnderstande well y
•
 I was neuer traytour to my kyng / ne to the re∣alme / & that I do me on god & on all the worlde / & therfore by my kynges leue I shall it preue & defende as a man ought to do. Than sayd Mortymer. Syr Ed∣monde it is so ferforth knowen y
•
 it may not be well gaynsayd / & that in presence of all that be here it shall be well proued Now had this fals Mortimer the same lettre that syr Edmond had taken to syr Iohn Daueryll in the castell of Corf for to take to kyng Edward his broder that syr Edmonde wyst not of / ne supposed


nothynge y
•
 syr Iohn Daueryll had ben so fals to deliuer his lettre in suche wyse to Mortimer / & thought no maner thyn∣ge of the lettre. Than Mortimer sayd to syr Edmonde & shewed y
•
 lettre sealed / & asked him yf that he knewe that lettre & the seale. This syr Edmōd loked theron & auysed hym longe tyme on y
•
 print of y
•
 seale / for he myght not se y
•
 lettre w
t
in / & wyst well y
•
 it was his seale / & thought that it had bē some lettre y
•
 had borne no grete charge / & thought nothynge on y
•
 other lettre / & sayd openly in herynge of them all. Ye forsothe this is my seale / & I wyll it not forsake. Loo sayd Morty∣mer / syrs ye here all what he hath sayd & that he knowlegeth y
•
 this is his lettre & his seale / & now ye shall here what is conteyned therin. And than this Morti∣mer opened y
•
 lettre y
•
 he had folden a fore togyder / & red it openly worde by worde in hering of them all. And whan y
•
 lettre was red he sayd / loo syrs ye haue herde all that here is wryten / & that he hath knowleged y
•
 this is his lettre & his seale & he may not go therfro. And than they cryed & gaue dome that he sholde be han¦ged & drawen & his heed smyttē of in ma¦ner of a traytour / & he & his heyres dys∣heryted for euermore / & so he was ladde forth & put in to pryson. And whan this was done / & y
•
 quene wyst that he was dampned by waye of y
•
 lawe bothe of lyf and lymme / & his heyres dysheryted for euer more / through open knowlegynge in playn court / wherfore them thought that it were good y
•
 the foresayd syr Ed∣mond were hastely slayne without wy∣tynge of y

 kyng / or els the kynge wolde lyghtly forgyue hym his deth / & than it sholde turne them to moche sorowe / so as he was empeched. And anone the quene through counseyle of Mortimer / & w

 he sholde sinyte of syr Edmondes heed of wod
ok erle of Kent without ony maner abydynge or respyte / vpon payne of lyfe & lymme / & that he shold haue none other execucyon bycause of taryenge / not withstandyng the iudgement. Than toke y

 kyng wyst therof / he was wonders sory / & let bury hym at y

¶ Of the deth of syr Roger Mor∣tymer erle of Marche.


ANd so it befell at y
•
 tyme that syr Roger Mortimer erle of marche was so proude & so hawteyne y
•
 he helde no lord of the realme his pere. And than became he so couetous that he folowed dame Isabell the quenes courte y
•
 was kyng Edwardes moder / & beset his pe∣nyworthes w
t
 the offycers of the quenes houshold in y
•
 same maner y
•
 the kynges officers dyd. And so he made his takyng as touchynge vytayles / & also of carya∣ges / & all he dyd for bycause of e
penses and to gadre tresour / & so he dyd with∣out nombre in all that he myght. Than made he hym wonders preuy with the quene Isabell / and so moche lordshyp & retynue he had / that all the grete lordes of Englonde of hym were adrad. Wher∣fore the kynge & his coūseyle towardes hym were agreued / & ordeyned amonge them to vndo hym through pure reason and lawe / bycause that kynge Edward that was the kynges fader tray
oursly through hym was murdred in y
•
 castell of Corf / as before is sayd more playn∣ly in the same parte of this boke of his deth. And some that were of the kynges


counseyle loued Mortimer / & tolde hym in preuite how that the kyng & his coun¦seyle were aboute frō daye to daye hym for to destroye & vndo. Wherfore Morti∣mer was sore anoyed and angry as the deuyll agaynst them y
t
 were of y
e
 kynges coūseyle / & sayd he wolde of them be a∣uenged how so euer he toke on. It was not longe afterward that king Edward and dame Philip his wyfe / & dame Isa¦bell the kynges moder / & syr Roger Mor¦tymer ne went vnto Notyngham there for to soiourne. And so it befel that quene Isabell through counseyle of Mortimer toke to her the keys of y
e
 gates of y
e
 castel of Notyngham / so that no man myght come in nor out by nyght / but through cōmaūdement of Mortimer / ne y
e
 kynge nor none of his coūseyle. And that tyme it befell so that Mortimer as a deuyll for wrath boyled / & also for wrath y
e
 he had agaynst the kynges men / & pryncypally agaynst them y
t
 had accused hym to the kyng of y
e
 deth of syr Edward his fader. And pryuely a counseyle was taken by∣twene quene Isabell & Mortymer & the bysshop of Lyncolne and syr Symond of Bedford & syr Hugh of Trompyngton & other preuy of theyr coūseyle for to vndo them al y
e
 had accused Mortimer vnto y
e
 kynge of his faders deth of treason & of felony. Wherfore all those y
t
 were of the kynges coūseyle whā they wyst of Mor¦timers castynge / pryuely came to kyng Edwarde & sayd that Mortimer wolde destroye them bycause they had accused hym of kyng Edwardes deth his fader and prayed hym y
t
 he wolde maynteyne them in theyr right. And these were the lordes y
t
 pursued this quarell / syr Williā of Mountagu / syr Vmfrey de Boghun / syr Williā his broder / syr Rauf of Staf∣ford / syr Robert of Herford / syr Willyam of Clynton / syr Iohn Neuyll of Nornby and many other of theyr consent / and all these swore vpon a boke to maynteyne the quarell in as moche as they myght. And it befell so after that syr Wyllyam of Mountagu ne none of y
e
 kynges fren∣des must not be herborowed in the castel for Mortimer / but went and toke theyr herborowe in dyuers places of y
e
 towne of Notyngham. And tho were they sore adrad lest that Mortimer 
shold
 destroye them / and in haste came vnto kyng Ed∣ward syr Willyam of Moūtagu y
t
 than was in y
e
 castell / and pryuely tolde hym that he nor none of his company sholde not take Mortimer without counseyle & helpe of Wyllyam of Eland constable of the same castell. Now truly sayd y
e
 king I loue you well / & therfore I counseyle you that ye go to the foresayd constable and cōmaunde hym in my name that he be your frende and your helpe for to take Mortimer / all thynge left vpon peryll of lyfe & lymme. Than sayd Moūtagu / syr my lord graūt mercy. Than went forth the foresayd Moūtagu and came to the constable of the castell / and told hym the kynges wyll. And he answered & sayd the kynges wyll shold be done in as mo∣che as he myght / and that he wolde not spare for no maner deth / and so he swore and made his othe. Than sayd syr Wil∣lyam of Mountagu to the constable / in herynge of all them that were helpyng vnto the same quarell. Now certes dere frende / vs behoueth to werke and do by your aduyse for to take Mortymer / syth that ye be keper of the castell & haue the keys in your warde. Syr sayd the con∣stable ye shall vnderstande that y
e
 gates of the castell ben locked with the lockes that dame Isabell sente hyther / and by nyght she hath the keys therof & layeth them vnder the leuesell of the bedde tyll on the morowe / and so ye may not come in to the castell by the gates in no ma∣ner of wyse / but I knowe an aley that


stretcheth out of the warde vnder y
e
 erth in to y
e
 foresayd castel / y
t
 goth in to y
e
 west whiche aley dame Isabell the quene ne none of her men / nor Mortymer ne none of his cōpany knoweth it not. And so I shall lede you through y
e
 aley / and so ye shall come in to the castel w
t
out espyenge of ony men y
t
 be your enemyes. And the same nyght syr William Moūtagu & all the lordes of his quarell / & the same con∣stable also wente to hors them / & made semblaūt as it were for to go out of Mor¦timers syght. But anone as Mortimer herde these tydynges / he wende y
t
 they 
wold
 haue gone ouer see for fere of hym And anone he & his company toke a coū∣seyle amonge them for to lette theyr pas∣sage / & sent lettres anone to the portes / so that none of the grete lordes sholde go home to theyr own coūtrees but yf they were arested & taken. And amōge other thynges Willyam Eland constable of y
e
 foresayd castell / priuely lad syr William of Moūtagu & his company by the fore∣sayd waye vnder the erth tyl they came in to the castel / & went vp in to the toure where as Mortymer was in. But syr Hugh of Trompyngton theym escryed hydously & sayd. A traytours it is all for nought that ye be comē in to this castell ye shall dye yet an euyl deth euerychone And anone one of them y
t
 was in Moun¦tagues cōpany by with a mace & smote the same Hugh vpon y
e
 heed y
t
 the brayn brast out & fell on y
e
 groūde / & so dyed he an euyll dethe. Than toke they Morty∣mer as he armed hym at y
e
 toures dore whan he herde y
e
 noyse of them for drede And whan quene Isabell sawe y
e
 Mor∣tymer was taken / she made moche so∣towe in hert / and these wordes to them sayd. Now fayr syrs I pray you y
t
 ye do no harme to his body a worthy knyght our welbeloued frende & our dere cosyn. Thā went they thens & came & brought Mortimer & presented hym vnto kynge Edward. And he cōmaunded to brynge hym in safe warde. But anone as they that were consentyng vnto Mortimers doynge herde tell y
t
 he was taken / they went and hydde them / and p
urly by nyght wente out of the towne eueryche in to his countree with an heuy herte & mournyng chere / and lyued vpon theyr londes as well as they myght. And so that same yere y
t
 Mortymer was taken he had at his retynue .ix. score knyghtes without squyers and sergeauntes of ar¦mes and fote men. And than was Mor∣tymer ladde to London / & syr Symond of Bedford was ladde with hym / and was taken to the constable of the toure to kepe. But afterwarde was Morty∣mers lyf examyned at Westmynster be∣fore the kynge & before all the grete lor∣des of Englonde / for peryll that myght fall to the realme / & to enquyre also whi¦che were consentynge to syr Edwardes deth the kynges fader / and also through whome the Scottes escaped fro Scan∣hope in to Scotlonde without the wyll of kyng Edward. And also how y
t
 char∣ter of Ragman was delyuered vnto the Scottes / wherin the homages & frau∣tees of y
e
 lordes of Scotlonde were con∣teyned / that the Scottes sholde do euer more vnto the Englysshe kynge for the realme of Scotlōde / wherfore in his ab∣sence he was dampned to be draw
 & hanged for his treason. And this mys∣chefe came to hym on saynt Andrewes euen / in the yere of y
e
 incarnacyon of our lorde Iesu Chryst. M .CCC. and rxx.






¶ Now kyng Edward gate agayn vnto hym gracyously y
e
 homages & f
au
es of Scotlonde / wherof he was put out through false coūseyle of quene Isabell his moder & syr Roger Mortymer / that was newly made erle of March
.



NOw haue ye herd how syr Iohn Bayloll in the tyme of peas was chosen to be kyng of Scotlonde / bycause that he came of y
e
 eldest doughter of the erle Dauid of Huntyngton y
t
 was kyng Alysaunders broder of Scotlond y
t
 dyed without heyre of his body begoten. And how this Iohn made his feaute and ho¦mage to kyng Edward Henryes sone y
e
 thyrde for his londes of Scotlonde. And how he afterwarde w
t
sayd his homage through coūseyle of the Scottes / in the yere of our lorde. M .CC .lxxiiij. and sent vnto the pope through a fals suggestion that he made his othe vnto the foresayd kyng Edward ouer his estate & his wyl of the whiche othe y
e
 pope hym assoyled through his bulles to hȳ sent. And ano∣ne as kyng Edward wyst therof / he or∣deyned anone his barons & came to Bar¦wyk & conquered the towne / at whiche conquest there were slayne .xxv. M. and vij .C. and Bayloll y
t
 was kyng of Scot¦londe came & yelded hym to good kynge Edward / & the kyng afterward delyue∣red him out of y
e
 toure of London / & all y
e
 grete lordes w
t
 hym that tho were taken at Barwyk / & gaue them saufconduyte to go in to Scotlonde. And the Scottes 
ith through theyr falsnes warred vpon the good kyng Edward. And whan syr Iohn Bayloll kyng of Scotlonde sawe all this he went ouer see vnto Dunpier and lyued there vpon his londes as wel as he myght tyll y
t
 the Scottes wold a∣mēde them of theyr mysoedes & trespace & 
ad w
t
 hȳ syr Edward his sone / wher∣fore y
e
 Scottes in despyte of hym called hym syr Iohn Turnlabaerd / for bycause that he wolde not offende ne trespace a∣gaynst y
e
 good kyng Edward of Englon¦de. And so he forsoke his realme of Scot¦londe / and set therof but lytel pryce. And this syr Iohan dwelled longe tyme in Fraūce tyll y
t
 he dyed there. And syr Ed∣ward his sone receyued his herytage / & dyd homage to y
e
 kyng of Fraūce / for his londes of Dunpier. And so it befell after¦ward that Edward y
t
 was Iohn Bay∣lols sone had w
t
 hym a squyer of englōde that was borne in yorkshyre / y
t
 was cal¦led Iohn of Barnaby / & this Edwarde Bayloll loued hym moche / & was nygh hym and full preuy. And so this Iohn of Barnaby was in debate with a frensshe man in y
e
 towne of Dūpier / & so he slewe hym & went his waye in all y
e
 haste y
t
 he myght in to y
e
 castell for to haue helpe of his 
lord.
 And anone came y
e
 officers of y
e
 towne to take Iohn of Barnaby as a fe∣lon / & syr Edward his 
lord
 holpe hym & rescowed hym / & by night made him go out of y
e
 castell / & so he went his waye & came in to Englonde w
t
out ony harme. And whan y
e
 kyng of Fraūce sawe y
t
 syr Edward had rescowed his felon / he be∣came wonders wrothe agaynst syr Ed∣ward / & anone let arest hym / & toke in to his hādes all his londes. Than dwelled syr Edward in pryson vnto y
e
 tyme y
t
 syr Henry of Beaumont came in to Fraūce / the whiche Henry was somtyme erle of Angos in Scotlonde through his wyfe & was put out therof whā y
e
 accordemēt was bytwene Englonde and Scotlond through quene Isabell & Roger Morti∣mer & theyr cōpany / for y
e
 maryage y
t
 she made bytwene Dauyd y
t
 was Robert y
e
 Brus sone & dame Ione of y
e
 toure kyng Edwardes syster of Englōde / & well vn¦derstode this y
t
 at y
e
 ende he shold come to his ryght / but yf it were syr Edwarde Bayloll y
t
 was ryght heyre of y
e
 realme of Scotlonde. And the kyng of Fraunce Lowys loued moche this syr Henry / & he was with hym ful preuy / & thought for to make a delyueraūce of syr Edwar¦de Bayloll yf he myght in ony maner of wyse. Tho prayed he y
e
 kyng y
e
 it wolde please his noble grace to graūt hym syr


Edward Baylols body vnto y
e
 next par∣lyament that he myght lyue w
t
 his own tentes in the meane tyme / & y
t
 he myght stande to be iudged w
t
 his peres at y
e
 par¦lyament. And y
e
 kyng graūted hym his prayer / & made the foresayd Edward to be delyuered out of pryson in the maner aboue said. And anone as he was out of prison / syr Henry toke hym forth w
t
 hym & ladde hym in to Englōde / & made hym dwell pryuely at y
e
 maner of Sandhall vpon Ouse in Yorkeshyre with the lady Vescy. And so he ordeyned him there an huge retynue of Englysshemen & also of alyens for to conquere agayne his hery∣tage. And so he gaue moche siluer to the sowdyours & to alyens for to helpe hym And they behyght for to helpe hym in y
t
 they myght / but they fayled hym at his moost nede. And at y
t
 tyme Donald erle of Moryf herde tell how y
t
 syr Edwarde Baylol was priuely come in to Englōde & came to hym & made grete ioye of his comynge agayn / and sayd to hym & be∣hyght hym y
t
 all y
e
 grete lordes of Scot∣londe shold be to hym attendaūt / & 
shold
 holde hym for kynge as ryght heyre of Scotlōde / & dyd to hȳ homage & feaute. Than came syr Henry of Beaumont to kynge Edwarde of Englonde / & prayed hym in y
e
 waye of charite that he wolde graūt of his grace to syr Edward Bay∣loll that he myght safely go by londe frō Sandhal vnto Scotlōde to cōquere his ryght & herytaunce in Scotlonde. The kynge answered & sayd. Yf that I suffre Bayloll go through my londe in to Scot¦londe / the people 
wold
 saye y
t
 I shold be assentyng vnto y
e
 company. Now syr I praye you that ye wolde gyue hym leue to take w
t
 hym sowdyours of Englysshe mē y
t
 they myght safely lede hȳ through your londe in to Scotlōde. And syr vpon this couenaunt y
t
 yf it so befall (as god it forbydde) he be dyscomfyted in batayle through the Scottes / that I & also all y
e
 lordes that holde w
t
 Bayloll ben for euer more out of your rentes that we haue in Englonde. And there y
e
 kyng vpon this couenaunt graunted theyr bone as tou∣chynge hym & those y
t
 were of the same quarell the whiche claymed for to haue londes & rentes in y
e
 realme of Scotlōde And these were y
e
 names of those lordes that pursued this foresayd quarell y
t
 is to saye / syr Edward Bayloll the whiche chalenged the realme of Scotlonde, syr Henry Beaumōt erle of Angos / syr Da∣uid of Stroboly erle of Atheles / syr 
∣frey of Mombray / Walter Comyn and many other y
t
 were put out of 
∣rytage in Scotlonde whan y
e
 
 made bytwene Englonde & S
 
 before is sayd. And ye shall 
 that these lordes toke w
t
 them .v .C. 
 of armes and .ij. M. archers & 
 & tho wente in to shyppe at 
 and sayled by the see tyll that they 
 vnto Scotlonde / & came to londe 
 kehorne .xij. myle from sayn
 Ioh
 towne. And anone sente out theyr 
∣pes agayne / for that they sholde no
 
 hurt ne empayred / neyther that no man sholde go in to y
e
 shyppes agayn though that they had nede / but abyde all 
 and not 
ee but stande / & rather 
 deth thā flee for to mayn
 
 quarell. Whan the erle of Fi
 a 
 man & a sterne herde that 
 comen for to take the londe of Scotlonde he came in haste to kynkehorne with xij. M. scottes for to destroye hym that he sholde not come to londe. But syr Ed∣warde Bayloll & his company dyscom∣fyted hym there / at y
e
 whiche discomfy∣ture syr Alysaūder of Seron was there slayne / & many other. The erle of Fyffe was tho sore & full yll ashamed / that so lytell a company had dyscomfy
d hym and shamefully put hym & all his com∣pany


that were alyue for to flee. Than came syr Edward Bayloll & toke y
e
 coun tre all aboute hym tyll he came vnto the abbey of Dunfermelin / & there he foūde vytayles for hym & for his folke / and a∣monge all thȳges he foūde in a chambre aboute .v .C. of grete staues of fyne oke with longe pykes of yren & of stele / & he toke them & deliuered them to the moost strongest men of his cōpany. And anone after he went from thens & lodged hym in a felde two myle fro saynt Iohannes towne. And whan the burgeyses of the towne herde how the erle of Fiffe was dyscōfyted through Bayloll / they were fore adrad / & brake theyr brydges y
t
 they had made ouer y
e
 water of Erne / so that Baylol myght not go ouer / wherfore he lodged hym there all y
t
 nyght / but lytell hede he toke of rest / & sayd vnto his peo∣ple. Now dere lordes ye knowe full well that we be now lodged bytwene our ene¦myes / & yf they may vs hampre there is no bote but deth / wherfore yf we abyde styll here all this nyght / I wene it shall turne vs to moche harme. For y
e
 power of Scotlonde may euer wexe & encreace and we may not so do / & we be but lytell people agaynst them / wherfore I praye you for y
e
 loue of almighty god make we vs bolde & hardy / & y
t
 we may myghtely take the Scottes this night / and boldly warre vpon them / & let vs pursue them this nyght / & yf they be through vs tra∣uayled & se our hardynes / other scottes that se them so trauayled and wery / the sorer wyll they be adrad w
t
 vs to fyght / & fyersly than shall we fyght with them & on them pursue / so y
t
 through y
•
 grace of god al y
•
 worlde shall speke of y
•
 dough tynes of our chyuairy. And syrs vnder∣stande well that al the company y
•
 came with syr Edward Bayloll graūted well to y
•
 coūseyle / & were therof ryght glad / and anone pursued vpon the Scottes y
•
 they became wonders wery. And Bay∣loll & his company sore folowed them / & did them moche harme & sorow through theyr assaut / so y
•
 they myght not for fe∣blenes them helpe / and for lytell people. But tho sayd y
•
 Scottes amonge them / what is now befall that so lytell people as Bayloll hathe in wynge dothe vs so moche trauayle & sorowe. Now certes it semeth vs that he werketh by grace / for he is wonders gracyous in his quarell / & we certes shal be deed or that we may come to hȳ vs for to yelde / syth that his fader set of vs no pryce. And amonge all other thynges Bayloll & his people pas∣sed the water of Erne / so that syr Roger of Swynerton the sone was fyers & an∣gry & went forth / & they sawe people of armes full well arayed / and forth they went vnto them & with them faught / & slewe & toke as many as wolde abyde. And neuertheles at y
t
 assaut they wende it had ben the grete hoost of Scotlonde. And whan it came to the morowe they gadred them togyder and rested them a whyle. And whyle y
e
 englisshmen rested them / the noble baron Thomas Vescy & the noble baron of stafford pricked theyr horses vp & down by y
e
 hylles for to kepe the estres of y
•
 coūtree / & as they prycked vp and down they sawe a grete hoost of good araye ordeyned in theyr wynges with helmes and sheldes shynynge co∣mynge vpon them. And there came tho two lordes agayn to Baylols folke / and sayd. Now for the loue of god be of good cōforte / for ye shall haue batayle anone right. And tho spake syr Fouke y
e
 sone of Gareyne a baron of grete renome and of dedes of armes. Syrs vnderstāde what I wyll saye. I haue seen many dyuers wynges / as wel amonge sarasyns and iewes as amonge y
•
 scottes / & yet sawe I neuer the fourth parte of the wynge fyght / & therfore yf ye wyll abyde our


enemyes we be ynough to fight against them. But yf we be not of good hert & of good courage we be but lost / & therfore for the loue of god let vs take to vs good herte / & let vs be bolde / & thynke we ne∣uer on our wyues ne on our childrē / but onely to cōquere our enemyes in batayle & through the helpe of our lorde god we shall them ouercome. And with y
t
 came the hoost of the Scottes towarde them full surely & agaynst syr Edward Bay∣loll in thre bataylles well arayed in ar∣mure / & wonders fyersly they came to∣warde Baylols company. But whā syr Donald erle of Marcil that was with y
•
 Scottes sawe all this / he said to Robert Brus the sone of Robert the Brus these wordes. Syr Roberte sayd he / full sore me forthynketh at my herte y
t
 these peo∣ple that Bayloll hathe brought w
t
 hym sholde dye with dynt of scottes swerdes lyth y
t
 they be chrysten men as we be / & therfore me thȳketh y
t
 it were grete cha∣rite to sende vnto them for to yelde them to our mercy / & raunsom them through greuous raunsom / for as moche as they haue takē our londe & done yll. Now cer∣tes sayd syr Robert y
•
 Brus / I haue wel perceyued that y
u
 art an enemy & a tray∣tour to Scotlonde / syth that y
u
 wylt con∣sent to saue our deedly enemyes / y
t
 haue done vs so moche sorowe & shame / & now it semeth well that ye be of theyr assent. Now certes Roberte (sayd syr Donald) falsly ye lye / I am not of theyr company ne of theyr cōsent / & that hastely ye shall se / for I wyll fyght w
t
 them rather than ony of this cōpany / & certes syr Roberte sayd he I shal in maugre of thy heed as∣sayle them or thou. And with that they prycked theyr stedes fyersly on Gaskmo re / & theyr wynges them folowed on a rēge / & tho came they & mette w
t
 Bayloll & his cōpany at an hangynge bough of the more in a strayte passage / and so fast they hasted them vnto the englysshmen that thousandes fell to the groūde eche ouer other in to an hepe bothe hors & mā Syr Bayloll & his men myghtely stode agaynst them & fast slewe the Scottes to the groūde / & many they fore woūded so longe tyll that they stode vpon them & foyned them w
t
 theyr swerdes & speres through theyr bodyes / and full sore they were trauayled vpon them / tyll y
t
 they became wōders wery / & wyst not what for to do. And y
•
 Scottes that were lefte alyue fledde away for to saue themselfe in the best maner that they myght. And tho pursued them syr Edwarde Ba
 and his men / & slewe of them tyll it was night. And fro thens they went to saynt Iohns towne / and toke it & helde them there / and vytayled themselfe at theyr owne wyll / for they foūde ynough wher with to make them mery. Than made Bayloll his men y
t
 were wounded go to shyppe for to sayle in to Englonde to 
 theyr woūdes. And in y
•
 tyme there was a flemyng in y
•
 see a stronge thefe & a rob¦ber y
t
 was called Crab / & this flem
 was dryuē out of Flaūdres for his wyc∣kednes / & therfore he came in to scotlond to holde with y
•
 scottes / & dyd as me
e harme to y
•
 Englisshmē as he myght to And this Crab mette this Bay
e
s men in y
•
 see y
t
 were woūded before in baray
e that were sent agayn in to Englonde 
 to hele theyr woūdes / & this Crab gaue to them a grete assaure and wold haue slayne them. But y
•
 Englysshmen defen∣ded them manfully & dyscōfyced Crab & his cōpany / & he fledde in to Scotlonde. And as he came towarde saynt Iohns towne / he foūde a grete cōpany of Scot¦tes y
t
 were comen agayn togyder after y
•
 discomfyture of Gaskemore the whiche besyeged Bayloll & his men in the same towne of saynt Iohn. And anone tolde to the Scottes how that he was disco∣fyted


of y
•
 Englysshmen that were woū¦ded at Gaskmore y
•
 went towarde Eng∣londe for to hele theyr woūdes / & sayd to the scottes y
t
 they sholde haue no power ne myght nor grace agaynst Edwarde Bayloll / bycause that he dyscomfyted & empayred all the chiualry of Scotlonde with a handfull of men as to accompte agaynst the Scottes that were slayne / wherfore he coūseyled to remeue y
•
 siege from saynt Iohns towne / & kepe them in y
•
 best maner that they myght. The Scottes vnderstode y
t
 Crab sayd sothe / & forsoke y
e
 syege & went thens by nyght & holpe themselfe in y
•
 best maner y
t
 they myght. Whan this thȳge was knowen through Scotlonde how that y
•
 lordes & knyghtes were discōfyted at Gaskmore of Scotlond through syr Edward Bay∣loll / ye shall vnderstande that y
e
 lordes & ladyes & the gentyls of Scotlonde came wonders fast to saynt Iohns towne / & yelded them to Bayloll / & to him dyd ho∣mage & feaute for theyr londes / & yelded them to his peas. And he them receiued frely / & fro thens he went to y
e
 abbey of Scone / & there he was crowned kyng of Scotlonde / & after he let crye his peas throughout all the londe. And at y
t
 same tyme it befell that kynge Edward helde his parlyament amonge his lyeges at newe castell vpon Tyne / for to amende y
•
 trespaces & the wronges y
t
 had ben done in his londe / & syr Edward Bayloll king of Scotlonde came to hym thyder / & dyd to hym homage & feaute for y
•
 realme of Scotlonde. And in this maner kyng Ed¦ward of Englōde gadred agayn his ho∣mages & feautees of Scotlond / wherof he was put out through counseyle & as∣sent of dame Isabell his moder / & of syr Roger Mortimer erle of Marche. Than toke Baylol kyng of Scotlonde his leue of kynge Edward of Englonde / & went thens in to his owne londe of Scotlonde & set but lytell by suche as had coūseyled & holpen hym in his quarell / wherfore they went from hym / & went & lyued by theyr londes & rentes in Scotlond. And so it befell not longe afterward that the king of Scotlonde ne remeued & came to the toure of Anand / and there toke his dwellyng / & thyder came to hym a cōpa¦ny of knyghtes / stronge men & worthy / and yelded them vnto y
•
 kyng / and bare them so fayre in dede & in coūtenaūce / so that he trusted moche vpon them. And anone as y
e
 traytours sawe y
t
 he trusted moche vpō them / they ordeyned amōge them fyfty in a company / & wolde haue slayne theyr lord y
•
 kyng. But through y
•
 grace of almighty god he brake through a wall an hole in his chambre / & as god wolde escaped theyr trechery / & all his men were slayne / & he escaped w
t
 moche drede vnto y
e
 towne of Cardoyll / & there he helde hȳ sore anoyed. And this befell on our ladyes euen y
e
 concepcyon. Than sent kyng Edward Bayloll to kyng Ed∣ward of Englōde how falsly & traytours∣ly he was in lytell tyme put to shame & sorow through his lyege men / on whom he trusted wonders moche / & prayed hȳ for the loue of god y
t
 he wolde maynteyn hym & helpe hym agaynst his enemyes The kyng of Englōde had of hym grete pyte / & behyght to helpe & socour hym / and sent hym worde that he shold holde hym in the foresayd cite of Cardoyll tyll that he had gadred his power. Than or∣deyned kynge Edwarde of Englonde a counseyle at London / & he let gadre his men in dyuers shyres of Englonde. And whan he was all redy / he went toward the towne of Barwyk vpon Twede / & thyder came vnto hym kynge Edward Bayloll of Scotlonde with his power & besyeged the towne / & made without y
•
 towne a fayre towne of pauylyons / & dy ched them all about / so that they had no


drede of the Scottes / & made many as∣sautes w
t
 gonnes & with other engynes to the towne / wherw
t
 they destroyed ma¦ny fayre houses / and chirches also were beten downe to y
•
 erth with grete stones that spytefully came out of gonnes & of other engynes. Neuertheles y
•
 Scottes kept well the towne / that y
e
 two kynges myght not come therin longe tyme. And the kynges abode there so lōge tyll those that were w
t
in the town fayled vitayles & also they were so wery of wakynge / y
t
 they wyst not what to do. And ye shall vnderstand y
t
 the Scottes y
t
 were in the towne of Barwyk through y
•
 comyn coū seyle and theyr assent let crye vpon the walles of the towne y
t
 they myght haue peas of the Englysshmen / & therof they prayed the kyng of his grace & mercy / & prayed hȳ of trewse for .viij. dayes vpon this couenaūt / y
t
 yf they were not resco∣wed in y
t
 syde of the towne toward Scot∣londe of y
•
 Scottes within .viij. dayes / y
t
 they wold yelde them vnto y
e
 kyng & the towne also / & to hold this couenaūt they profred to y
•
 king .xij. hostages out of the towne of Barwyk. Whan the hostages were delyuered to y
•
 kyng / anone they of the towne sent to y
•
 Scottes / & told them of theyr sorowe & myschefe. And y
•
 Scot∣tes came than priuely ouer the water of Twede to y
•
 bought of y

 abbey / & syr wil¦lyam Diket y
t
 was tho steward of Scot¦londe & many other y
t
 came w
t
 hym / put themselfe in grete peryll of theyr lyues at y
t
 tyme / for they came ouer a brydge y
t
 was broken & the stones away / & many of theyr company were there drowned / but the foresayd Wyllyam went ouer & other of his cōpany / & came by y
•
 shippes of Englonde / & slewe in a barge of Hull xvj. men / & after they went in to y
•
 towne of Barwik by y
e
 water syde. Wherfore y
•
 Scottes helde than y
•
 towne rescowed / & asked theyr hostages agayn of the kyng of Englonde. And the kynge sente them worde agayne y
•
 they asked theyr hosta∣ges w
t
 wronge / syth that they came in to the towne of Englōde syde / for couenaūt was bytwene them y
t
 the towne shold be rescowed by y
e
 halfe of Scotlonde. Than anone cōmaūded kyng Edward to yelde the towne or he wold hange y
•
 hostages. And the Scottes sayd the towne was rescowed well ynough / and therto they wold them holde. Whan kyng Edward sawe the Scottes breke theyr couenaūt that they had made / he was wonders wroth / & anone let take syr Thomas fitz Willyam & syr Alyfaūder of Feton war∣deyn of Barwyk / the whiche Thomas was parsone of Dunbar / & let them be taken fyrst afore that other hostages / by cause that syr Alysaunders faders was keper of the towne. And tho cōmaunded euery daye two hostages of y

 towne tyll that they were all done to dethe / but yf they yelded y
•
 towne / & so he sholde teche them to breke theyr couenaūt. And whā they of the towne herde these tydynges they became wonders sory / & sent to the kyng y
t
 he wolde graūt them other. v

 bytwene tho hon∣dred men of arntes and .xx. mē of armes myght by strength go bytwene them to the towne of Barwik them force vitayle that y

 were in y

t
 were hangen out / & wente on the walles of y
e
 towne in dyuers pla∣ces as naked as they were borne / saue onely theyr shertes & their preuy clothes & helde theyr swerdes naked & the poynt downward in theyr hādes / & put ropes & halters aboute theyr neckes / & yelded vp the keys of y
e
 towne & of the castell to kyng Edward of Englonde with grete fere and drede of herte. And whan kyng Edward sawe this / as a merciable king and lorde receyued them all to grace / & a fewe of the gretest persones of estate & of gouernaunce of the towne he sente in to Englonde there to abyde theyr raunsom & the kynges grace. And all y

 pope trewse was takē there bytwene Fraūce & Englonde for .ix. monethes than nexte folowynge. And aboute Myg
elmasse kyng Edward came agayne in to Eng∣lond with a gloryous victory. ¶ And in the .xxiij. yere of his regne in y

est par∣tyes of the worlde there began a pas
y∣lence and deth of sarasyns & pay
 that so grete a deth was neuer herde of afore / & that wasted away the people so that vnneth the tenth persone was lefte alyue. ¶ And in the same yere aboute y

 south coūtrees there fell so moche rayne & so grete waters / that frō Chrystinasse vnto mydsomer there was 
 daye nor nyght but that it rayned som∣what / through whiche waters y

 were won¦ders brode & depe / & therin buryed them & made a renge of deed bodyes & cast aly tell erth to couer them aboue / & than cast in an other renge of deed bodyes / and an other renge aboue them. And thus were they buryed & none other wyse / but yf it were so y
t
 they were men of grete estate so that they were buryed as honestly as they myght. ¶ And after all this in the


xxiiij. yere of kynge Edwardes regne it was done him to wyte of a treason that was begon at Calays & ordeyned to sell that towne for a grete somme of florens to kynge Philip of Fraūce / through the falsnes & ordynaūce of a knyght y

 was called syr Geffrey of Cheruey that was wōders preuy w

 noblest & gentyllest lordes & many other worthy mē of armes that were present w
t
 him for y
•
 solempnite of y
•
 hygh feest. And well & wysely in all the haste that he myght & as pryuely as he myght he went ouer the see to Calays. And y
•
 same yere y
•
 good kynge Edward helde his Chrystmasse at Hauerynge / & the morow after newe yeres day y
•
 kyng was in y
•
 castell of Calays w
t
 his men of armes y
•
 none of the alyens wyst therof. And y
•
 fals cōspyratour & traytour Gef∣frey of Cherney syth that he myght not openly haue his purpose of y
•
 castell / pry uely & stelingly he came & helde y
•
 towne with a grete hoost. And whan he w
t
 his men were comen / he payed the foresayd somme of florens as couenaūt was to a Genewey in y
•
 towne y
•
 was keper of the castell & consentyng to the same Geffrey in all this falsnes & trechery / & boūde y
•
 Englysshe mynstrels & seruauntes that were in y
•
 castell y
•
 they myght not helpe themselfe ne let them of theyr purpose. And than wenynge y
•
 they had ben sure ynough / they spake al theyr wickednes & falsnes openly on hygh y
•
 al mē might here. And now shall ye here how they were deceyued / for they came in by a pre¦uy posterne ouer a lytell brydge of tree / & whan they were comen in subtylly & pri¦uely y
•
 brydge was drawen vp & kepte y
•
 none of them y
•
 came in might go out / ne¦no moo come in to them. And anone our Englysshe men went out at preuy holes and wyndowes & ouer the walles of the towne & of y
•
 castel & went & faught man¦ly with y
•
 frensshmen y
•
 were without / & had y

 better of them / the whiche whan they were occupyed by thēselfe on theyr syde / the kyng y
•
 was within the towne hauynge w
t
 hym scarsly but .xxx. men of armes drewe out his swerde & w
t
 a loude voyce he cryed on hye. A saynt Edward A saynt George. And whan the people herde that / they came rēnynge to hym & gaue to theyr enemyes so grete assaute that there were moo than. iij .C. men of armes & many moo other slayn / & many fled awaye. And so by y
•
 grace of god the victory fell to y
•
 Englysshmen. Than the kynge toke w
t
 hym this Geffrey y
•
 was fynder of this treason & also many other Frensshe prisoners / & within a whyle af¦ter he came agayne in to Englonde. And in this same yere & in the yere afore / & in the yere nexte folowynge was so grete a pestylence of men from the eest in to the west / & namely through botches / y
•
 they that sekened as on this daye dyed on the thyrde daye after / to y
•
 whiche men y
•
 so dyed in this pestylence had but lytell re∣spyte of theyr lyggȳge. Than pope Cle∣ment of his goodnes & grace gaue them full remyssyon & forgyuenes of all theyr synnes that they were shryuen of / & this pestylence lasted in London fro Mighel∣masse vnto August nexte folowynge / al∣moost an hole yere. And in these dayes was deth without sorowe / weddynges without frendshyp / wylfull penaūce / & derth without scarsete / & fleynge w
t
out refute or socour / for many fledde frō pla∣ce to place bycause of the pestylence / but they were enfected & might not escape y
•
 deth / after that y
•
 prophete Isaie sayth Who that fleeth fro the face of drede / he shall fall in to the dyche. And he y
•
 wyn∣deth hym out of y
•
 dyche / he shall be hol∣den and tyed with a grenne. But whan this pestylence was cesed as god wolde


vnnethes y
•
 tenth parte of y

 people was left on lyue. ¶ And in y
•
 same yere began a wonders thȳge / that all y
•
 were borne after y
•
 pestylence had two cheketethe in theyr heed lesse than they had afore.

 is to saye / the lorde Fitz water / & the lorde Graunson / & other worthy knyghtes / of whiche knightes the kyng ordeyned syr Robert Knolles a proued knyght & well assaied in dedes of armes for to be gouer¦nour / and that through his coūseyle all thynge shold be gouerned & dressed. And whā they came in to Fraūce / as lōge as they dwelled & helde them hole togyder the frensshmen durst not fall vpon them And at y
e
 last about y
e
 begȳuynge of wyn¦ter for enuy & couetyse that was amōge them & also discord / they sondred them & parted in to dyuers cōpanyes vnwysely & folisshly. But syr Robert Knolles & his men went & kepte them safe w
t
in a castel in Brytayn. And whan the frensshmen sawe y
t
 our men were deuyded in to dy∣uers cōpanyes & places / not holdyng ne strēgthyng them togider as they ought to do / they fell fyersly on our men / & for y
e
 moost party toke them or slewe them / & those y
t
 they myght take led w
t
 them pry¦soners. ¶ And in y
e
 same yere pope Ʋr∣ban came fro Rome to Auinyon bycause that he shold accorde and make peas by∣twene y
e
 kynge of Fraūce & the kynge of Englonde for euermore. But alas or he began his treatyse he dyed w

e
 erth & buryed newe in y
e
 abbey of saynt Ʋictory fast by Mar cile / of y
e
 whiche abbey he was somtyme abbot hymself. And in bothe places y
t
 he was buryed in there be many grete my∣racles done & wrought through y
e
 grace of god to many a mānes helpe & to y
e
 wor¦shyp of almyghty god. ¶ After whome folowed next & was made pope Gregory cardynall deken / that before was called Piers Roger. ¶ In this same yere y
e
 cite of Lymoge rebelled & faught agaynst y
e
 pryuce as other cytees dyd in Guyen for grete taxes / costages / & raūsoms y
t
 they were put & set to by prȳce Edward / whi¦che charges were importable & charge∣able / wherfore they turned fro hym & fel to y
e

e
 foresayd cite & destroyed it almoost to y
e

e
 cite. And thā for to say y
e
 sothe for dyuers sekenes & maladyes y
t

 his wyfe & meyny / leuyng behynde hym in Gascoyn the duke of Lancastre & syr Ed¦mōd erle of Cambridge w

t
 hym of certayne thynges tou∣thynge his warre in Normandy / where kyng Edward had lefte certayn lyeges in his stedetyl he came agayn. But king Edward might not spede of that that he asked hym. And so y
e
 kynge of Nauerne with grete worshyp & grete gyftes toke his leue & went home agayn. ¶ And a∣bout the begynnynge of Marche whan the parliamēt at Westmynster was be∣gon thē kynge asked of the clergy a sub∣sydy of .l. M. poūde / y
e
 whiche by a good auysement & by a generall conuocacyon of the clergy it was graūted & ordeyned that it 
shold
 be payed & reysed of the lay fee. And in this parlyament at y
e
 request & askynge of the lordes in hatred of men of holy chirche / the chaunceler & the tre∣sourer


that were bysshops / & the clerke of the preuy seale were remeued and put out of theyr offyce / & in theyr stede were seculer men put in. And whyle this par∣lyament lasted there came solempne em¦bassatours fro y
e
 pope to treate with the kynge of peas / & sayd y
t
 the pope desyred to fulfyll his predecessours wyll / but for all theyr comynge they spedde not.






¶ Of the besyegynge of Rochell / & how the erle of Penbroke & his cōpany was there taken in y
e
 hauen w
t
 Spanyardes and all his shyppes brent.


He .ix. daye of Iune kynge Ed∣ward in y
e
 .xlvij. yere of his regne helde his parlyamēt at Wynchestre / & it lasted but .viij. dayes / to whiche parlya¦ment were sompned by wryte of men of holy chirche .iiij. bysshops & .iiij. abbots w

t
 they were defamed of / y
t
 is to saye / that they were rebell & wold aryse agaynst y
e
 kyng ¶ This same yere y
e
 duke of Lācastre & the erle of Cambrydge his broder came out of Gascoyne in to Englonde / & toke & wedded to theyr wyues Peters dough∣ters somtyme kyng of Spayne / of whi∣che two doughters y
e
 duke had y

e
 yonger. And y
t
 same time there were sent two cardynals fro y
e
 pope / y
t
 is to saye an Englysshe cardinall & a cardy¦nall of Parys to treate of peas bytwene these two realmes / whiche whan they had ben bothe lōge eche in his {pro}uynce & coūtrees fast by tretynge of the foresayd peas / at y
•
 last they toke w
t
 them y
e
 lettres of procuracy & went agayne to Rome w
t
∣out ony effect of theyr purpose. In this yere there was a strōge batayle on y
e
 see bytwene Englysshmen & Flemynges / & the Englisshmen had the victory / & toke xxv. shyppes w
t
 salte / & s
eynge & drow∣nyng all y
e
 men y
t
 were therin vnwyting them y
t
 they were of y
e
 countree / & moche harme sholde haue fallen therof had not peas & accorde soone be made bytwene them. ¶ This yere y
e
 frensshmen besye∣ged y
e
 towne of Rochell / wherfore y
e
 erle of Penbroke was sent in to Gascoyn w
t
 a grete cōpany of men of armes for to de∣stroye ȳ syege which passed y
e
 see & came safe to y
e
 hauen of Rochell / & whan they were there at y
e
 hauens mouth or y
t
 they myght entre / sodeynly came vpon them a stronge nauy of Spanyerdes whiche ouercame y
e
 Englysshmen in moche ble∣mysshynge / hurtyng & sleynge of many people / for as moche as y
e
 Englysshmen were not than redy for to fyght ne war∣ned of thē. And as y
e
 Spanyerdes came vpon them all the Englysshmen eyther they were takē or slayne / and. r. of them were sore woūded to the doth
 & al the
r shyppes brent / & there they toke y
e
 erle w
t
 a grete tresour of the realme of Eng

 mer euen y
e
 whiche is sa
t Etheldredes day / & ledde them w
t
 them in to Spayn
 And of this myschefe was no grete w
 der / for this erle was a full 
 l
uer as an open lechour. And also in a certa
e parlyament he stode & was agaynst the ryghtes & fraūchyses of holy chirche & also he coūseyled y
e
 kynge & his co
 that they shold aske more of men of holy chirche than other {per}sones of the lay fee. And for the kynge and other men of his counseyle accepted and toke rather euyll opynyons & causes agaynst men of holy chirche than he dyd for to defende and maynteyne the ryght of holy chirche, 
t was after seen many tymes for lacke of fortune and grace they had not so grete victory ne power against theyr enemyes as they dyd before. ¶ This same yere y
e
 kyng w
t
 a grete hoost entred the see to re∣meue


the syege of Rochell / but y
e
 wynde was euer contrary to hym / & suffred hȳ not longe tyme to go ferre fro the londe / wherfore he abode a certayn tyme vpon y
e
 see costes abyding after a good wynde & yet came it not. So at the last he came thens w
t
 his men to lonoward agayn / & anone as he was on lōde y
e
 wȳde turned & was in an other coste thā it was afore.






¶ How the duke of Lancastre w
t
 a grete hoost wente in to Flaundres & passed by Parys through Burgoyn and through all Fraūce tyll he came to Burdeux.


SOone after in the .xlviij. yere of y
e
 regne of kyng Edward the duke of Lancastre w
t
 a grete power went in to Flaūdres and passed by Parys through Burgoyn & through all Fraunce tyll he came to Burdeux w
t
out ony maner with standyng of y
e
 frensshmen / & he did them but lytel harme / saue he toke & raūsoned many places & townes & many men: & af¦ter let them go frely. ¶ The same yere y
e
 kyng sent certayne embassatours to the pope / prayenge hym y
t
 he 
shold
 leue of & not medle in his courte of the kepynges & reseruacyons of benefyces in Englōde & y
t
 those y
t
 were chosen to bysshops sees & dignitees frely & with full myght ioye & haue & be confermed to y
e
 same of theyr metropolytans & archebisshops as they were wont to be of olde tyme. Of these poyntes & of other touchyng y
e
 kȳg & his realme / whā they had theyr answere of the pope / the pope enioyned them y
t
 they 
shold
 certyfy hym agayn by theyr lettre of y
e
 kynges wyll & of his realme or they determyned ought of y
e
 foresayd articles ¶ In this same yere dyed Iohn y
e
 arche¦bysshop of Yorke / Iohn bysshop of Ely / William bysshop of worcestre / in whose stedes folowed & were made bysshops by auctorite of y
e
 pope / mayster Alexander Neuyll to the archebysshopryche of Yor∣ke / Thomas of Arundell to the bysshop∣ryche of Ely / & syr Henry wakefelde to y
e
 bysshopryche of worcestre. In y
e
 whiche tyme it was ordeyned in y
e
 parlyament that all cathedrall chirches sholde ioye & haue theyr eleccyons hole / & that y
e
 kyng fro y
t
 tyme afterwarde sholde not wryte agaynst them y
t
 were chosen / but rather helpe them by his lettres to theyr cōfyr∣macyon. This statute dyd moche {pro}fyte And in this parliament was graūted to the kynge a dyme of the clergy & a .xv. of lay fee. ¶ In the .xlix. yere of kyng Ed∣ward dyed mayster Willyam wytlesey archebysshop of Caunterbury / and the monkes of y
e
 same chirche asked & desy∣red a Cardynall of Englonde to be arche¦bysshop / & therfore y
e
 king was agreued & purposed to haue exiled y
e
 monkes of y
e
 same hous. And they spent moche good or they myght haue the kynges grace & his loue agayn / but yet wold y
e
 king not cōsent to theyr eleccyon of y
e
 cardinall / ne of y
e
 pope also ne his cardynals. ¶ And at y
e
 begynnynge of August it was trea¦ted & spoken at Bruges of certayn poyn∣tes & artycles hangyng bytwene y
e
 pope & the kyng of Englonde / & this treatyse lasted almoost two yere. At y
t
 last it was accorded bytwene them y
t
 the pope fro y
e
 tyme forth sholde not vse ne dele with y
e
 reseruacyons of benefyces in Englonde and that y
e
 kyng sholde not graūte ne let no benefyces by his wryte that is called Quare impedit. But as touchynge the eleccyon abouesayd there was no thȳge touched ne done. And that was wyted & put vpon certayne clerkes the whiche rather supposed & hoped to be auaunced and promoted to bysshopryches whiche they desyred & coueyted by the courte of Rome rather thā by ony other eleccions. ¶ This same yere about Candelmasse there mette togyder at Bruges many


noble & worthy men of bothe sydes & re∣almes to treate of peas bytwene the two kynges. And this treatyse lasted .ij. yere w
t
 grete costes & large expenses of bothe partyes. And at y
e
 last they went & depar¦ted thens w

e
 bisshop of Bangor was made bysshop of Herford. And this same tyme in a certayne treatyse & spe∣kyng of peas trewse was takē bytwene Englonde & Fraūce fro mydsomer to the nexte mydsomer after. And aboute y
e
 be∣gynnynge of Apryll y
e
 duke of Brytayne w
t
 many erles / barons & worthy lordes & men of Englonde went ouer see in to Bri¦tayne where he had all his lust / desyre & purpose ne had y

 duke of Angeo with many other lordes and prelates of bothe realmes for to treate of peas.






¶ Of the deth of prynce Edwarde / & of the lord Latimer and dame Alyce Pe

NOt lōge after the .lj. yere of kyng Edwardes regne he let ordeyn & holde at Westmynster the gretest parlia¦ment y
t
 was seen many a yere afore. In the whiche parlyament he asked of the comynalte of y
e
 realme as he had done a∣fore a grete subsidy to be graūted to him for defendyng of hym & his realme. But the comyns answered y
e
 they were so of
 day by day greued & charged w
t
 so many talages & subsidyes y
t
 they might no lon¦ger suffre suche burthens & charges / & y
e
 they knewe & wyst well ynough that y
e
 kyng had ynough for sauynge of hym & his realme / yf y
e
 realme were wel & truly gouerned / but y
e
 it had ben so longe 
 gouerned by yll offyeers / that y
e
 
ea

t
 rychesse. And in these thynges they profred themselfe / yf the kynge wolde certaynly to pre

•
 they 
shold
 be remeued & put away / & in theyr stedes wyse men & worthy that were true & well assayed & proued / & of good gouernaūce 
shold

 parlyament. And for this same Pyers tolde & publysshed the trouth & rehersed the wronges agaynst the foresayd dame Alyce & other certayn persones of y

 last he shold be shent & accused for y

 kynge of Fraūce / & was sworne to hym & became his man and behyght hym a grete nauy out of Spayne to cōfusyon and destroyenge of Englōde. But y

 ryghtfull god to whom no preuite is vnknowen / suffred hȳ first to be shent & spylte or y

 king of Englonde & his people in his realme / in the which groūde this same Iohn was borne / & wyckedly through batayle de∣stroyed or he brought aboute his cursed purpose. ¶ In y

 of Iune he dyed at Shene / & is buryed worshyp fully at westmȳster / on whose soule god haue mercy. This kyng Edward was forsothe of a passyng goodnes & full gra¦cyous among all the worthy men of the 
world
 / for he passed & shone by vertue of grace gyuē to hym frō god aboue all his p̄decessours y

 were noble men & worthy & he was a well herted man & an hardy for he drad neuer no myshappes ne bar∣mes ne euyl fortune y

 myght fall a noble warryour & a fortunate / for both on lōde & see & in al batayles & assembles w

 a pas¦sing glory & ioy he had y

 victory / he was meke / benigne / homely / sobre & soft to al men as wel to strangers as to his owne subiectes & to other y

 what mā had behold his face / or had dremed of hȳ he hoped y
•
 daye y
•
 al thynge shold hap to hym ioyfull & lykyng. And he gouerned his kingdom gloriously vnto his age / he was large in gyuyng & wyse in expēces


he was fulfylled with al honeste of good maners & vertues / vnder whom to lyue it was as for to regne / wherfore his fa∣me & his loos spronge so ferre y
•
 it came in to hethynnesse & Barbary / shewynge & tellynge his worthynes & manhode in all londes / & y
•
 no londe vnder heuen had brought forth so noble a kyng / so gentyll & so blissed / or might reyse suche another whā he was deed. Neuertheles lechery & meuynge of his flesshe haūted hym in his age / wherfore the rather as it is to suppose for vumesurable fulfyllynge of his lust his lyfe shorted the sooner. And hereof take good hede lyke as his dedes bereth wytnes / for as in his begȳnyng all thynges were Ioyfull and lykyng to hym & to all people. And in his myddle age he passed all people in hygh Ioye / worshyp & blyssednes. Ryght so whan he drewe in to age drawyng downward through lechery & other synnes lytell & lytell all those Ioyfull & blyssed thynges and prosperyte decreased & myshapped / and unfortunate thynges and vnprofy∣table harmes with many euyls began for to sprynge / and the more harme is / it contynued longe tyme after.

And this was done the sondaye nexte after the feest of saynt Clement / in the .xx. yere of kynge Rychardes regne. ¶ And than the .xxv. daye of August nexte after by euyll exci∣tacyon & fals coūseyle and grete wrath & malyce that the kynge had of olde tyme to his vncle the good duke of Glocestre & to the erle of Arundell / & to y

And this was theyr appoyntment / that they shold come vpon hȳ whan he were in his bedde & a slepe on a fether bedde / & anone they boūde hym hande & fote and charged hym for to lye styll. And whan that they had done thus / they toke two towelles / & made on them two rydynge knottes / & cast the towelles aboute his necke / & than they toke the fether bedde that laye vnder hym & cast it vpon hym and than they drewe theyr towelles eche wayes / & some laye vpon y

e
 haste with a wonders grete nōbre of people. And as soone as he was comen he sent for y

 iudge∣ment the kyng let make in all the haste a long hous & a large of tymbre y
e
 whiche was called an hall / & couered with tyles ouer / & it was open all aboute on bothe sydes & at the endes / y

uyers & pryncypally of yemen of Chestershyre / whiche ye
ten & archers the kyng toke to his own courte and gaue them bowge of courte & good wages to be kepers of his owne body bothe by nyght & by daye aboue al other persones & moost loued & best trust / the whiche soone afterward turned y
e
 kyng to grete losse & shame / hyndrynge & his vtter vndoynge & destruccion as ye shall here afterwarde. And that tyme came sir Henry of Derby with a grete meyny of men of armes & archers. And y
e
 erle of Rutlonde came with a stronge power of people bothe of men of armes & archers The erle of Kent brought a grete power of men of armes & archers / the erle Mar shall came in the same maner / & the lord

this was his iudgement. He shold go on fote w
t
 his handes boūde behynde hym from y
e
 place that he was iudged in / & so forth through the cite of London vnto y
e
 toure hyll / & his heed to be smytten of / & so it was done in dede in the same place. And .vl. of the gretest lordes that sate on his iudgement rode with hym vnto the place there he was done to dethe / & so to se that y
e
 execucyon were done after the dome / & by the kynges cōmaundement with them wente on fote men of armes & archers a grete multytude of Chestre shyre men / in strengthynge of y
e
 lordes y
t
 brought this erle to his dethe / for they were in drede leest y
e
 erle sholde be resco∣wed & taken from them whan they ca∣me in to London. Thus he passed forth through the Cite vnto his deth / & there he toke it full pacyently / on whose soule god haue mercy Amen. And than came the Austyn freres & toke vp y
e
 body & the heed of this good erle / & bare it home to theyr place / & buryed him in theyr quere And on y
t
 morow after was syr Rychard erle of warwik brought in to the parlya ment there as the erle of Arundell was for iudged / & they gaue the erle of war∣wyk the same iudgemēt that y
e
 foresayd erle had / but the lordes had compassyon on hym bycause he was of more greter age / and released hym to perpetuall pry son / & put hym in the yle of Man. And than on the mondaye nexte after y
e
 lorde Cobham of Kent and syr Iohn Cheyn knyght were brought also in to the par∣lyament in to the same hall / & there they were iudged to be hanged and drawen / but through the prayers and grete in∣staunce of all the lordes that iudgement was forgyuen them / and released to per petuall pryson. ¶ And this same tyme was Rychard Whyttyngdon Mayre of London / and Iohn Wodecocke & Wyl∣lyam Askam sheryues of London. And they ordeyned at euery gate of London durynge this same parlyament stronge watche of men of armes & archers / and through out euery warde also. And the kynge made .v. dukes & one Markeys & foure erles / & the fyrst of them was the erle of Derby / and he was made duke of Herford / and the seconde was the erle of Rutlonde / & he was made duke of Awe∣marle / & the thyrde was the erle of Kent and he was made duke of Surry / & the fourth was the erle of Huntȳgdon / & he was made duke of Excestre / & the fyfth was the erle of Notyngham / & he was made duke of Northfolk. And the erle of Somerset was made Markeys of Dor set / & the lorde Spenser was made erle of Glocestre / & the lorde Neuyll of Raby was made erle of Westmerlonde / & syr Thomas Percy was made erle of Wor∣cestre / & syr Willyam Scrope that was tresourer of Englonde was made erle of Wylshyre / & syr Iohn Montagu erle of Salisbury. And whan y
e
 king had thus done he helde the parlyamēt & ryall feest vnto all his lordes & to all maner of peo∣ple that thyder wolde come. ¶ And this same yere dyed syr Iohn of Gaūt y
e
 kyn∣ges vncle & duke of Lancastre in the bys∣shops Inne in Holborne / & was brought fro thens to saynt Paule / & there y
e
 kyng made & helde his enteremēt well & wor∣thely with al his lordes in the chirche of saynt Paule in London / & there he was buryed besyde dame Blaūche his wyfe that was doughter & heyre vnto y
e
 good Henry y
t
 was duke of L

e
 same yere there fell a 
cyon bytwene the duke of Herford & y
e
 duke of Norfolke in so moche y
•
 they waged batayle & cast down theyr gloues / & than they were ta ken vp & ensealed / & the batayle ioyned & the daye set / & the place assygned where and whan / & this sholde be at Couentre And thyder came the kyng w
t
 all his lor

e
 felde well & clene armed & well arayed with all theyr wepen & redy to do theyr batayle / & were redy in y
e
 place to fyght at vtteraūce. But y
e
 kyng had them cesse & toke the quarell in to his handes. And forth with ryght there present exiled the duke of Herford for terme of .x. yere / & the duke of Norfolke for euermore. And syr Thomas Arundell archebisshop of Caū terbury was exiled y
t
 same tyme for euer & deposed out of his see for malyce of the kyng. And anone these thre worthy lor∣des were cōmaunded & defended y
e
 kyn∣ges realme. And anone they gate them shyppes at dyuers hauens & went ouer the see in to dyuers lōdes eche his waye And y
e
 duke of Norfolke went to Venise & there he died / on whose soule god haue mercy Amen. And than kynge Rychard made a clerke of his syr Roger Walden arche bysshop of Caūterbury. ¶ And in the .xxij. yere of kynge Richardes regne by fals coūseyle & ymaginacyon of coue∣tous men that were aboute hym were made & ordeyned blancke chartres / and made them to be ensealed of al maner ry the men throughout y
e
 realme / in so mo∣che y
t
 they compelled diuers people to set theyr seales therto. And this was done for grete couetyse / wherfore al good her∣tes of y
e
 realme were clene turned away fro y
e
 kyng for euer after. And that was vtter destruccyon & ende to hym y
t
 was so hygh & so excellent a prynce & kyng / & through couetous & fals coūseyle falsely betrayed. Alas for pyte y
e
 suche a kynge myght not se. And than kynge Rychard set his kyngdome and his ryall londe of Englonde to ferme vnto foure persones whiche were these / syr Wyllyā Scrope erle of Wylshyre & tresourer of Englond & syr Iohn Busshe / & Henry Grene / & syr Iohn Bagot knyghtes / whiche turned them to myschefe & deth within a lytell tyme / as ye shall fynde here afterwarde wryten. ¶ And than kyng Rychard ma de grete ordynaūce & went hymself ouer see into Irlonde & many grete lordes w
t

t
 men of armes & archers & moche grete stuffe & ryght good ordy∣naūce as longed vnto warre. And or he passed ouer y
e
 see he ordeyned & made 
 Edmond of Langley his vncle y
e
 duke of Yorke his lewtenaū
 of Englonde in his absence / with the gouernaūce & coūsey
e of these .iiij. knyghtes y
t
 had taken Eng∣londe to ferme of the kyng. And than he passed the see & came in to Irlonde and there he was well & worth
ly receyued And these rebelles that ben called 
 Irysshmen came downe to the kynge & yelded them to him bothe body & go
des all at his owne wyll / & swore vnto 
 to be his lyege men / & there dyd to hym homage & feaute & good seruyce & thus he cōquered y
e
 moost parte of Irlende in a lytell tyme. And whyle that kyng 
 chard was thus in Irlonde syr Henry of Bolyngbroke erle of Derby that y
e
 kyng had made before duke of Herford y
•
 
 che duke the kyng had exiled out of this londe was comen agayn in to Englonde for to chalenge y
e
 dukedom of Lancast
 as for his right & true herytage. And he came downe out of Fraūce vnto 
alays And there mette hȳ syr Thomas Arun∣dell y
t
 was archebysshop of

t
 
he erle of Huntyngdon & w
t
 the duke of Excestre the whiche was tho in the castell of

worthy duke & the archebysshop of Caū¦terbury Arundell shypped in y
e
 hauen of Calais / & drewe theyr course northward & arryued in Yorkshyre at Rauensporne fast by Wydelyngton / & there he came & entred fyrst the londe / & two lordes with hym and theyr meyny. And than moche people of the realme that herde of his co¦mynge & knewe where y
t
 he was / anone they drewe vnto hym & welcomed these lordes / & so couraged them in all maner thynge / and passed forth in to the londe and gadred moche people to them. And whan kyng Rychard herde & wyst that these two lordes were comen agayne in to Englonde and were londed. Than the kynge lefte his ordynaūce in Irlonde & came in to Englondward in all the haste that he myght / and came to the castell of 
lyut / and there he abode for to take his counseyle & what myght be done / but to hym came none. And whā syr Thomas Percy erle of Worcestre y
t
 was y
e
 kynges steward wyst and knewe this / anone he came in to the hall amonge all y
e
 people / and he brake the yerde of y
e
 ryall kynges housholde / & anone euery man was dis∣perpied & went his waye & forsoke theyr mayster & souerayn lorde / and lefte hym alone. And thus was kynge Rycharde brought downe & destroyed / & stode hym selfe alone without comforte or socour or ony good counseyle of ony man / alas for pite of this ryall kyng. And anone came tydȳges that syr Henry of Boling broke was vp with a stronge power of people and that all y
e

¶ Of kynge Henry the fyfth that was kynge Henryes sone.




ANd after the deth of king Henry the fourth regned kynge Henry his sone that was borne at Monmouth in Wales / that was a worthy kyng & a gracyous man and a grete conquerour. And in y
e
 fyrst yere of his regne for grete loue and goodnes he sent to the f
res of Langley there as his fader had do bury kynge Rychard the seconde / and let take his body out of the erth agayn / & dyd do brȳge it to Westmynster in a ryall chare couered with blacke veluet and baners of dyuers armes about / & all the horses drawing y
•
 chare were trapped in blacke and beten with dyuers armes / & many a torche brennynge by all the waye tyll he came to Westmynster / & there he let make for hym a ryall and a solempne en∣terement / & buryed hym by quene Anne his wyfe / as his owne desyre was / on y
•
 ferther syde of saynt Edwardes 
yne in y
•
 abbey of saynt Peters of Westmyn∣ster / vpon whose soule god haue mercy. ¶ And in this same yere were certayne lollers taken & fals heretykes y
t
 had pur¦posed through false treason for to haue slayne our kyng / & for to haue destroyed all the clergy of y
•
 realme / & they myght haue had theyr false purpose. But our lorde god wolde not suffre it / for in haste our kynge had warnynge therof & of all theyr fals ordinaūce & werkyng / & came sodeynly with his power to saȳt Iohns without sinythfelde / & anone they toke a certayn of the lollers & fals heretykes / & brought them to y
e
 kynges presence and there they tolde all theyr fals purpose & ordynaūce how they wolde haue done & wrought / yf they myght haue regned & had theyr wyl / & there they told whiche were theyr capytayns & gouernours / & than y
e
 king cōmaūded them to the toure of Londō: & than toke moo of them bothe win y
e
 cite & w
t
out / & sent thē to Newgate & to bothe Co
ters. And than they were brought in examinacion afore y
e
 clergy & the kynges Iustyces / & there they were cōuicte for theyr fals heresy / & dampned before y
•
 Iustyee for theyr fals treason / & this was theyr iudgemet / y
t
 they sholde be drawen frō y
e
 toure of London to saint


Giles felde / & there to be hanged & brent on y
e
 galowes. Also there was taken syr Roger Acton knyght for heresy & eke for treason agaynst y
e
 kyng & y
e
 realme / & he came afore y
•
 clergy & was cōuict for his heresy to be brent / & dampned before the Iustyces to be drawen from the toure of London through the cite to saynt Giles felde / & to be hanged & brent. ¶ And in y
e
 seconde yere of kynge Henryes regne he held a coūseyle of all y
e
 lordes of y
e
 realme at Westmȳster / & there he put hym this demaūde / & prayed & besouhgt them of theyr goodnes & of theyr good coūseyle & good wyll to shewe hym as touchyng y
e
 tytell & the right y
t
 he had to Normandy Gascoyn & Guyen / the whiche y
e
 king of Fraūce whelde wrongfully & vnryght∣fully / y
•
 whiche his auncestres before hȳ had by true tytell of cōquest & right hery¦tage / the whiche Normādy / Gascoyn & Guyen y
e
 good kyng Edward of Wynd∣sore & his auncestres before hym had hol¦den all theyr lyf tyme. And his lordes ga¦ue hym coūseyle to sende embassadours to the kyng of Fraūce & his coūseyle y
t
 he shold gyue vp vnto hym his ryght hery¦tage / y
t
 is to saye Normandy / Gascoyn & Guyen / y
•
 whiche his predecessours had holden afore hȳ / or els he wold it wynne with strengthe of swerde in shorte tyme with y
e
 helpe of almighty god. And than the Dolphyn of Fraūce answered to our embassadours & saydi this maner / that the kyng was ouer yonge & to tender of age to make ony warre as agaynst hȳ / & was not lyke yet to be a good warryour to do & make suche a cōquest there vpon hym. And somwhat in scorne & despyte he sent to hȳ a tonne full of tenes balles bycause he shold haue somwhat to playe withall for him & for his lordes / for that wolde become hym better than to mayn¦tayn ony warre. And than anone our lor¦des y
t
 were embassadours toke theyr le∣ue & came in to Englonde agayne & tolde the kynge & his couseyle of the vngoodly answere y
t
 they had of the Dolphin / & of the present y
•
 whiche he had sente to our kynge. And whan the kynge had herde theyr wordes & y
•
 answere of y
•
 Dolphyn he was wonders sore agreued & ryght euyll apayed towarde the frensshmen & towarde the kynge & the Dolphyn / and thought to auēge hym on them as soone as god 
wold
 sende hym grace & myght And anone let make tenes balles for the Dolphyn in all y
•
 haste that he myght / & they were grete gonstones for the Dol∣phyn to playe withall. And than anone the kynge sent for all the lordes & helde a grete coūseyle at Westmynster / & told to them the answer y
t
 they had of the Dol¦phin & of his worthy present y
t
 he sent to hym & to his lordes to playe w
t
all. And there y
e
 kyng & his lordes were accorded that they shold be redy in armes w
t
 theyr power in the best araye y
t
 myght be done and gete all the men of armes & archers that myght be goten / & all other stuffe y
t
 longed to warre / & to be redy w
t
 all theyr retynue to mete at Southhampton by Lāmasse nexte folowynge without ony delaye / wherfore y
e
 kynge ordeyned his nauy of shyppes with all maner stuffe & vytayle that lōged to suche a warryour of all maner ordynaunce in the hauen of Southhampton to y
e
 nombre of .CCC. and .xx. sayles. And thā fell there a grete dysease and a foule myschefe. For there were thre lordes whiche that the kyng trusted moche on / & through false coue∣tyse they had purposed & ymagined the kynges deth / & thought to haue slayne hym & all his bretherne or he had taken the see / whiche thre lordes were named thus / syr Rycharde erle of Cambrydge broder to y
e
 duke of yorke / y
e
 seconde was the lord Scrope tresourer of Englōde / y
•
 thyrd was sir Thomas Gray knyght of


the North coūtree. And these thre lordes aforesayd for lucre of money had made a promesse vnto y
•
 Frensshmen for to haue slayne kyng Henry the fyfth and all his bretherne by a false trayne sodeynly or they had ben ware. But almyghty god of his grete grace helde his holy hande ouer them & saued them from these pe∣rillous meiny. And for to haue done this they receyued of y
•
 frensshmen a millyon of gold / & that was there openly proued And for theyr fals treason they were all thre iudged to deth / & this was y
•
 iudge∣ment / that they sholde be ladde through Hampton / & without northgate there to be heded. And thus they ended theyr ly∣ues for theyr fals couetyse and treason. And anone as this was done the kynge & all his meyny made them redy & went to shyppe and sayled forth with .xv. hon∣dred shyppes / & arryued within Seyne at Kydecause vpon our ladyes euen the Assumpcyon in Normandy w
t
 all his or∣dynaūce / & so went forth to Harflet / & he besyeged the towne all about by londe & also by water / & sent to the capytayne of the towne & charged hym to delyuer the towne. And y
e
 capytayne sayd that he de¦lyuered hym none / ne none he wolde hȳ yelde / but badde hym do his best. And than our kyng layde his ordinaūce vnto the towne / that is to saye / gonnes / engy¦nes & tripgettes / and shotte & cast at the walles & eke at the towne / & cast downe bothe toures & towne & layde them on y
•
 erth / & there he played at the tenes with his hard gonne stones. And they y
•
 were with in y
•
 towne whan they sholde playe theyr songe was well away & alas that euer ony suche tenes balles were made / & cursed al tho y
•
 warre began / & y
•
 tyme that euer they were borne. ¶ And on the morowe y
•
 kyng let crye at euery gate of the towne that euery man 
shold
 be redy on the morowe erly to make assaute to y
•
 towne. And Willyam Boucher & Iohn Graūt with .xij. other worthy burgeses came to the kyng & besought hym of his ryall pryncehode & power to withdrawe his malyce & bestruccyon that he dyd to them / and besought hym of .viij. dayes respyte & trewse yf ony rescowe myght come to them / & els to yelde vp y
e
 towne to hym w
t
 al theyr goodes. And than the kyng sent forth y
•
 capytayne & kepte the remenaūt styll w
t
 hym. And y
•
 lord Gau∣corte y
t
 was capytayne of y
•
 towne went forth to Roen in all y
e
 haste vnto the Dol∣phyn for helpe & socour / but there was none ne no man of rescowe / for the Dol∣phyn 
wold
 not abyde. And thus this ca¦pytayne came agayne vnto the kynge & yelded vp y
e
 towne / & delyuered hym the keys. And than he called his vncle y
e
 erle of Dorset & made hym capytayne of the town of Harflet / & deliuered him y
•
 keys & bad hȳ go & put out all y
•
 frēsshe people bothe men womē & children / & stuffe his town of Harflet w
t
 englysshe people. And than y
e
 kyng sent in to Englōde & let crye in euery good town of Englōde / y
•
 what crafty mā wold come thyder & enhabyte hym there in y
•
 town he shold haue 
s & 
houshold
 to hȳ & to his heyres for euer more. And thyder went many marchaūtes & crafty mē / & enhabyted them there to strength the towne / & were welcome. And whā y
•
 kyng sawe y
•
 this town was well stuffed bothe of vytayles & of men / this worthy prince toke his leue & went toward Calays by lond / & y
•
 frensshmen herde of his comynge / they thought for to haue stopped hȳ his waye y
•
 he sholde not passe that waye / in all y
•
 haste y
•
 they myght brake al y
•
 bridges where as ony passage was for hors & man / in so moche that there myght no man passe ouer the ryuers neyther on hors ne on fo
e / but yf he shold haue bendrowned. And therfore our king w
t
 all his people went & sought


his way ferre vp toward Paris / & there was all y
•
 ryall power of Fraūce assem∣bled & redy to gyue hym batayle / & for to destroye all his people. But almyghty god was his guyde & saued hȳ & all his meyny / & defended hym of his enemyes power & purpose thanked be god y
•
 saued so his owne knyght & kyng in his ryght full tytel. And than our kyng beholdyng & seynge y
•

t
 a meke herte & a good spiryte lyfte vp his handes to almyghty god / & besought hȳ of his helpe / & y
•
 daye to saue his true ser¦uaūtes. Than our kynge gadred all his lordes & other people aboute & bad them al to be of good chere / for they shold haue a fayre & a gracyous victory & the better of all theyr enemyes / & prayed them to make thē redy to y
•
 batayle / for he wolde rather dye y
•
 daye in the felde / than to be taken of his enemyes / for he wold neuer put y
•
 realme of Englonde to raūsom for his persone. And y
•
 duke of Yorke fell on his knees & besought y
•
 kyng of a bone / y
•
 he 
wold
 graūt hym y
t
 daye y
•
 vaūtward in his batayle / & the kyng graūted hym his askyng / and sayd gramercy cosyn of Yorke / & prayed hym to make hym redy. And than badde he euery man to ordeyn hym a stake of tree & sharpe bothe endes that y
•
 stake myght be pyght in y
•
 erth a slope / that theyr enemyes shold not ouer come them on horsback / for y
t
 was theyr fals purpose / & arayed them for to ouer ryde our meyny sodeynly at the fyrst co∣myng on of them at y
•
 first brunt. And al the nyght before y
•
 batayle y
•
 frensshmen made many grete fyers & moche reuell with howting & showting / & played our kyng & his lordes at y
•
 dyse / & an archer alwaye for a blanke of theyr money / for they wend al had bē theyrs. The morne 
ose y

 daye gan sprynge / & the kyng by good aduyse let araye his batayle & his wynges / & charged euery man to kepe them hole togyder / & prayed them all to be of good chere. And whā they were re∣dy he asked what tyme of y
e
 daye it was & they said pryme. Than sayd our kyng now is good tyme / for al englōd prayeth for vs: & therfore be of good chere & let vs go to our iourney. And thā he sayd w
t
 an hye voyce / in the name of almighty god & saynt George auaūt baner / & saynt Ge¦orge this day thyne helpe. And than the Frensshmen came pryckynge downe as they wold haue ouer rydden all our mey¦ny / but god and our archers made them ryght soone to stomble / for our archers shotte neuer arowe amysse / but it perys∣shed & brought to y
e
 groūde bothe hors & man / for they shotte y
t
 daye for a wager. And our stakes made them toppe ouer terue eche one ouer ouer / y
•
 they laye on hepes two speres length of heyght. And our kyng w
t
 his meyny & with his men of armes & archers y
t
 thacked on them so thycke with arowes & layde on w
t
 stakes And our kyng with his handes fought manly y

But god that daye fought for vs. And after came there tydynges to our kynge that there was a newe batayle of frensshmen ordeyned redy for to stele on hym & came towardes hym. And anone our kyng let crye that euery man sholde slee his pry∣souers that he had taken / & anone araye the batayle agayne redy to fyght with the Frensshmen. And whan the Frenssh¦men sawe that our men kylled downe theyr prysoners / than they withdrewe


them & brake theyr batayle and al theyr araye. And thus our kyng as a worthy conquerour had that daye the victory in the

 fyrst comynge of our kynge there were nombred by herawdes vnto .CCC. M. of men and women and chyldren / what yonge & olde.

¶ Of the lawe of kyng Henry the fyfth and what he ordeyned for kyng Richard and for hymselfe after his deth.


HEre is to be noted that this kynge Henry y
e
 fyfth was a noble prynce after he was kynge & crowned / how be it before in his youth he had ben wylde recheles & spared nothynge of his lust ne desyres / but accomply
hed them af∣ter his lykyng. But as soone as he was crowned / anoynted and sacred / anone so∣deynly he was chaūged in to a newe mā & set all his entent to lyue vertuously in maynteynynge of holy chirche / destroy∣enge of heretykes / kepyng Iustyce & de∣fendyng of his realme & subgeetes. And for as moche as his fader had deposed by his labour the good kyng Rychard / & pyteously made hym to dye / & for the of∣fence done to him agaynst his legeaunce he had sent to Rome to be assoyled therof For which offence our holy fader y
e
 pope enioyned hym to make him to be prayed for perpetually / & lyke as he had done to be taken frō hym his naturall lyfe / ther∣fore he sholde do foūde .iiij. tapers to bren perpetually about his body that for the extynccyon of his bodyly lyfe his soule may euer be remembred & lyue in heuen in spirituall lyfe. And also y
e
 he shold eue∣ry weke on the daye as it came about of his deth haue a solēpne masse of Requi
 & on the euen afore a Dirige with .ix. les∣sons / & a dole to poore people alway on y
e
 daye of .xj. shyllynges & .viij. pens to be deled peny mele / & ones in y
e
 yere at his annyuersary his enteremēt to be holden in the moost honest wyse / & to be deled y
e
 daye .xx. poūde in pens to poore people & to euery monke .xx. shyllynges / whiche all these thinges per
ournted this noble kynge for his fader. For kyng Henry the fourth his fader perfourmed it not du∣rynge his lyfe / whome as it was sayd


god touched and was a lepre or he dyed. ¶ And than this noble prynce let do call all the abbottes & pryours of saynt Be∣nettes ordre in Englonde / & had them in the chapter hous of Westmȳster for the reformacion of the ordre / wherin he had comynycacyon / & also with bysshops & men of the spiritualte / in so ferforth that they doubted sore y
e
 he wolde haue had y
e
 temporaltees out of theyr hādes / wher∣fore by the aduyse / labours & procuryng of the spiritualte encouraged the kynge for to chalenge Normādy & his ryght in Fraūce / to the entent to set hym a werke there / that he shold not seke occasyons to entre in to suche maters. And al his lyfe after he laboured in y
e
 werres in conque ryng a grete parte of y
e
 realme of Fraūce that by the agrement of the kyng Char¦les he had all the gouernaunce and rule of the realme of Fraunce / & he was pro∣claymed regent & heyre of Fraunce. And so notwithstandynge for all this grete warre that he had / yet he remembred his soule / and also that he was mortall and must dye / for whiche he ordeyned by his lyfe tyme the place of his sepul∣ture where he is buryed / and there is euery daye thre masses perpetually son∣gen in a chapell ouer his sepulture / of whiche the myddle masse and the fyrst & the last masse shall be as it is assygned by hym / as it appereth by these verses folowynge.

 west coūtre / to whiche the erle of Warwyk came fro Calays w
t
 many of y
e
 olde sowdyours / as Andrewe Trollop & other / in whose wysdome as for y

e
 lordes of his re∣alme / to come & wayte on hym in theyr moost best defensable aray. And so euery man came in suche wise y
t
 the kyng was stronger & had more people than y
e
 duke of yorke & y
e
 erles of warwyk & of Salys¦bury. For it is here to be noted that eue∣ry lorde in Englonde durst not disobey y
e
 quene / for she ruled peasybly all y
t
 was done about y
e
 kyng / whiche was a good & a well disposed man. And thā whan y
e
 kyng was comen to the place where as they were / the duke of yorke & his felaw shyp made theyr felde in y
e
 strōgest wyse & purposed verily to haue bydē & fought but in y
e
 nyght Andrewe Trollop & all y
e
 olde sowdyours of Calays w

e
 felde leuynge behynde them the moost party of theyr people to kepe y
e
 felde tyll on the morowe. Than the duke of Yorke w
t
 his second sone departed through wales to∣ward Irlonde / leuynge his eldest sone y
t

¶ How y
e
 erles of Marche / Warwyk / & Salysbury entred in to Calays / & how the erle of warwyk went in to Irlonde.


THan kynge Henry beynge w
t
 his hoost in y
e
 felde not knowynge of this sodeyn departynge / on the morowe foūde none in y
e
 felde of y
e
 said lordes / sent out in all y
e
 haste men for to folowe & pur∣sue after to take them / but they met not with them as god wolde. And than the kyng went to Ludlowe / & despoyled the castell & the towne / & sent the duchesse of yorke & her children to y
e
 duchesse of Bo∣kyngham her syster / where as she was kepte longe tyme after. And forth w
t
 the kyng ordeyned the duke of Somerset to be capytayn of Calays. And these other lordes so departed as afore is sayd were proclaymed rebelles & grete traytours. Than y
e
 duke of Somerset toke to hym all y
e
 sowdyours y

 departed from y
e
 felde


and made hym redy in all the haste to go to Calays & take possessyon of his offyce And whan he came there he foūde y
e
 erle of warwik therin as capitayn / & y
e
 erles of Marche & of Salysbury also / & than he londed by Scales & went to Guynes and there he was receyued. And it fortu¦ned that some of tho shyppes that came ouer with hȳ came in to Calays hauen by theyr free wyll / for y
e
 shypmen ought more fauour to y
e
 erle of warwik than to the duke of Somerset / in whiche shyp∣pes were taken dyuers men / as Ienyn Finkhyl / Iohn felow / Kaylles & Purser whiche were byheded soone after in Ca∣lays. ¶ And after this came men dayly ouer the see to these lordes to Calays / & began to wexe stronger & stronger / and they borowed moche good of the staple. And on y
t
 other syde y
e
 duke of Somerset beynge in Guynes gate people to hym / whiche came out & scarmysshed w
t
 them of Calays / & they of Calays with them whiche endured many dayes. Duryng this scarmysshynge moche people came ouer dayly vnto these lordes. Than on a tyme by y
e
 aduyse & counseyle of y

e
 lorde Ryuers & y
e
 
lord
 Scales his sone / & toke many shyppes in the hauen / & brought them all to Calays / w
t
 whiche shyppes many maryners of theyr free wyl came to Calays to serue the erle of Warwyk. And after this the erle of warwyk by y
e
 aduyse of the lordes toke al his shyppes & māned them well & sayled hȳselfe in to Irlonde for to speke w
t
 the duke of Yorke & to take his aduise how they shold entre in to Englonde. And whan he had ben there & done his crandes / he returned a∣gayn toward Calays / & brought w
t
 hym his moder y
e
 coūtesse of Salisbury. And comynge in y
e
 west countre vpon the see the duke of Excestre admyral of englōde beynge in y
e
 grace of dieu accōpanyed w
t
 many shippes of warre mette w
t
 the erle of warwyk & his flete / but they fought not / for y
e
 substaūce of y
e
 people beynge w
t
 the duke of Excestre ought better wyll & fauour to y
e
 erle of warwik than to hym & they departed & came safe to Calays. ¶ Than y
e
 kȳges coūseyle seynge y
t
 these lordes had gotē those shyppes fro Sand wyche & taken y
e
 
lord
 Ryuers & his sone ordeyned a garnyson at Sandwyche to kepe y
e
 towne / & made one Moūford cap
 tayn of y
e
 towne / & y
t
 no mā ne v

 go to Calais. Thā they of Calais 
 this / made out mayster Denham & ma∣ny other to go to Sandwyche & so the
 dyd / & assayled the towne by water & by londe / & gate it / & brought the capytayn ouer see & smote of his heed / & yet dayly men came ouer to them fro all partyes.

Ebrancus the .v. kyng of Britons buyl∣ded yorke & called it after his own name Caerbranke. He buylded also two other citees / one in Scotlōde & is called Eden∣burgh / & an other toward Scotlonde in the ende of Englonde & is called Alcliud. ¶ R. Edenburgh is a cite in the londe of Pictes bytwene y
e
 ryuer of Twede & the scottysshe see / & hyght somtyme y
e
 castell of Maydens / & was called afterwarde Edenburgh of Edan kynge of Pictes / y
t
 regned there in Egfridus tyme kyng of Northūberlonde. Alcliud was somtyme a noble cite / & is now well nygh vnkno∣wen to all Englysshmen. For vnder the Brytons & Pictes & Englysshmē it was a noble cite to y
e
 comynge of the Danes. But afterward about y
e

e
 da∣nes destroyed the coūtree of Northum∣berlonde. But in what place of Britayn that cite Alcliud was buylded / auctours tell diuersly. Beda li .j. sayth that it was buylded by west that arme of y
e
 see that departeth bytwene the Britons and the Pictes somtyme there Seuer{us} famous wall endeth westward / and so it semeth by hym that it is not ferre frō Ca
le

e
 cite of Alcliud is that cite that now is cal¦led Aldburgh / y
t
 is to saye / an olde tow∣ne / & standeth vpon the ryuer Ous not ferre fro Burghbrigge / that is .x. myle westward out of yorke / & it semeth that he preueth that by Gaufride in his boke of dedes of Brytons / he wryteth y

 Al¦cliud was that cyte that now is called Burgham in the north coūtree of w

the storyes that one Alcliud was in York shyre / an other in westmerlōd / & one fast by the ryght syde of y

 Alcliud was a ryght stronge cyte as Beda sayth / & y

 cyte standeth fast by a ryuer y
t
 is called Cliud / & there is not suche a ryuer in Yorkshyre nor in West∣merlonde as men of the coūtree tell me. Some men saye that the ryuer Cliud is now named Sulwatche. Sulwatche is but .v.

t
 ryuer of Humber vnto y

M. and two. knyghtes fees .ixxv. thousan∣de / wherof men of religyon haue .xxvij. thousande and .xv. any ghtes fees. But now the wodes ben hewen towne and the londe newe tylled / and made moche more than was at that tyme / and many townes & vyllages buyiden / & so there be many moo vyllages & 
 now than were at that tyme. And where as afore is wryten that Cornewayle is not fet amonge the shyres of Englonde / it may stande amonge them well ynough for it is neyther in wales nor in Scot∣londe / but it is in Englonde / & it loyneth vnto Deuenshyre / & so may there be ac∣counted in Englonde .xxxvii. shyres and an hath with the other shyles.

 Of y

t
 tyme of the Danes were .x. kynges / the whi∣che were subgecte somdele to other kyn∣ges. Neuerthelesse o
t est & longest they were vnder the kynges of Merci

 to the tyme y

 Egbert the kynge of west∣saxon ioyned y

And than the elder kynge Edwarde ioyned bothe the kȳgdomes to his orane. The fyfth kyng dome was of westsaxon / & dured longest of all these kyngdomes / & had in the eest syde fouthsaxon / in the north Tamyse / in the south & in the west the see Occean In that kyngdome regned Serdryk w

Neuer∣thelesse at the begyunynge this kyng∣dome of Mercia was departed in to thre In west Mercia / in myddell Mercia / & eest Mercia. The .vij. kyngdome was Northamhymbro{rum} / y

 south syde & hyght Deyra / & that other was y
•
 north syde & hyght Brenicia / as it were two kyngdomes / & the ryuer departed these two kyngdomes that tyme / for the kyngdome of Deyra was from y

•
 em∣perours tyme whan Mari{us} Aruiragus sone was kyng of Brytons / one Rodryk kyng of Pictes came out of Scicia & be∣gan to destroye Scotlonde. Marius the kyng slewe this Rodryk / & gaue y
•
 north party of Scotlonde y
•
 hight Cathenesia to the men that were come with Rodryk & were ouercome by hym / for to dwell in But these men had no wyues / ne none myght haue of y
•
 nacion of Brytōs / ther fore they sayled in to Irlonde / & toke to theyr wyues Irysshe mēnes doughters by y
•
 couenaūt that y
•
 moders blode shold be put tofore in successyon of herytage. ¶ Gir. ca .xvij. Neuertheles Sirin{us} su{per} Virgiliūsayth y
•
 Pictes agatirses y
•
 had some dwellyng place about y
•
 waters of Scicia / & they ben called Pictes of peyn¦tynge & smytynge of woundes / therfore they are called Pictes as peynted men. These men and these gothes ben all one people. For whan Maximus the tyraūt was gone out of Brytayne in to Fraūce for to occupy y
•
 empyre. Than Gracian{us} and Valentinianus y
•
 were bretherne & felowes of the empyre brought these go∣thes out of Scicia w
t
 grete gyftes / w
t
 fla¦terynge & fayre byhestes in to the north coūtree of Brytayne. For they were stal∣worth & stronge men of armes. And so these theues and brybouts were made men of londe & of coūtre & dwelled in the north coūtre / & helde there cytees & tow∣nes. ¶ Gaufre. Carancius the tyraunt slewe Bassianus / and gaue the Pictes a dwellyng place in Albama that is Scot¦londe / there they dwelled longe tyme af∣terward & medled with Brytons. ¶ 
. Than sith the Pictes occupyed fyrst the north syde of Scotlonde / it semeth y
•
 the dwellynge place y
•
 this Carancius gaue them is y
•
 south syde of Scotlonde / that stretcheth from the thwarte ouer walle of Romayns werke to y
•
 Scottysshe see / and conteyneth Galleway and Lodouia that is Lodeway. ¶ Therfore Bede
 .iij. ca .ij. speketh in this maner. N
an the holy man conuerted y
•
 south Pictes. Afterward the Saxons came & made y
•
 coūtre longe to Brenicia the north party of Northumberlonde / vnto y
•
 tyme that Kynadius Alpinus sone kynge of Scot¦londe put out y
•
 Pictes / & made y
•
 coūtre that lyeth bytwene Twede & the Scot∣tysshe see long to his kyngdom. ¶ Beda li .j. ca .j. Afterwarde longe tyme y
•
 Scot¦tes were led by duke Renda / & came out of Irlonde that is the propre countre of Scottes / & with loue or with strengthe made them a place fast by the Picces in the north syde of the arme of the see that breketh in to the londe in the west syde / that departed in olde tyme bytwene Bri¦tons & Pictes. Of this duke Renda the Scottes had y
•
 name & were called Dal∣rendin{us} / as it were Rendaes parte / for in theyr speche a parte is called dal. ¶ Gir. pri. The Pictes myght haue no wyues of Brytons / but they toke them wyues of Iryssh Scottes / and promysed them fayre for to dwell with them / & graūted them a londe by y
•
 see syde / there y
•
 see is narowe. That londe is now called Galle¦way. Marianus. Irysshe Scottes lon∣ded at Argall y
•
 is Scottes clyf for Scot¦tes londed there for to do harme to y
•
 Bri¦tons / or for y
•
 place is next to Irlōd for to come a londe in Brytayn. ¶ Beda. And


so the Scottes after y
•
 Britons & Pictes made y
•
 thyrde people dwellynge in Bry¦tayn. ¶ R. Than after y
•
 came y
•
 Saxōs at the prayenge of the Brytons to helpe them agaynst y
•
 Scottes & Pictes. And the Britons were soone put out in to wa¦les / & Saxons occupyed the londe lytell & lytell / & efte more to the Scottysshe see And so Saxons made the fourth maner of men in y
•
 ylonde of Brytayn. ¶ Beda lib .v. ca .ix. For Saxons & Angles came out of Germania / yet some Brytōs that dwel nygh call them shortly Germayns ¶ R. Neuertheles aboute y
•
 yere of our lorde. viij .C. Egbartus kynge of West∣saxon cōmaūded & bad al men call y
•
 men of y
•
 londe Englysshmen. ¶ Alfre. Than after that the Danes pursued the londe aboute a. ij .C. yere / that is to saye / fro y
•
 foresayd Edbartus tyme vnto saynt Ed¦wardes tyme / & made y
•
 fyfth maner of people in y
•
 ylonde / but they fayled after warde. At the last came Normans vnto duke Willyam & subdued Englysshmen & yet kepe they y
•
 londe / & they made the syxth people in y
•
 ylonde. But in the fyrst kynge Henryes tyme came many Fle∣mynges & receyued a dwellȳge place for a tyme besyde Maylros in the west syde of Englonde / & made the seuenth people in the ylonde. Neuertheles by cōmaūde¦ment of the same kynge they were put thens & dryuen to Hauerfordes syde in y
•
 west syde of wales. ¶ R. And so now in Brytayn Danes & Pictes fayle all out / and fyue nacyons dwell therin / that ben Scottes in Albania / that is Scotlonde. Brytayne in Cambria / y
•
 is Wales / but that Flemynges dwell in / y
•
 is west Wa¦les. And Normans & Englysshmen ben medled in al y
•
 ylōde / for it is now doubte in storyes how and in what maner they were put away & destroyed out of Bry∣tayn. Now it is to declare how y
•
 Pictes were destroyed & fayled. ¶ Gir .j. ca .vij. Brytayn was somtyme occupyed with Saxons / & peas was made & stablisshed with y
•
 Pictes / than y
•
 Scottes y
•
 came with the Pictes sawe y
•
 the Pictes were nobler of dedes and better men of armes though they were lesse in nombre than y
•
 Scottes. Than the Scottes hauynge therof enuy turned to theyr natural trea¦son y
•
 they haue ofte vsed. For in treason they passe other men / & bē traytours as it were by kynde / for they prayed all the Pictes / & specially the gretest of them to a feest / & wayted theyr tyme whan the Pictes were mery and had well dronke they drewe vp nayles y
•
 helde vp holowe benches vnder the Pictes / & the Pictes vnware sodeynly fell in ouer y
•
 hammes in to a wonderfull pytfall. Than y
•
 Scot¦tes fell on y
•
 Pictes & slewe them / & lefte none alyue. And so of two maner people the better warryours were al destroyed But the other that ben y
•
 Scottes whi∣che ben traytours all vnlyke to y
•
 Pictes toke {pro}fyte by that fals treason / for they toke all that londe / and holde it yet vnto this tyme / & call it Scotlōde after theyr owne name. In kynge Edgarus tyme Kynadius Alpinus sone was duke & 
∣der of the Scottes / and warred in Picte londe & destroyed the Pictes. He warred syxe tymes in Saxon / & toke all y
•
 londe that is bytwene Twede & y
•
 Scottysshe see with wronge & with strength.






¶ Of the lāguages / of maners & vsage of the people of that londe. Ca .xv.


AS it is knowen how many ma∣ner of people ben in this ylonde there ben also so many languages and tongues. Neuertheles W
n and Scottes that ben not medled with other nacyons kepe yet theyr language & spe∣che. But yet y
•
 Scottes that were som∣tyme confederate and dwelled with Pi∣ctes drawe somwhat after theyr speche.


But the Flemynges y
•
 dwell in the west syde of Wales haue lefte theyr straunge speche & speke lyke to saxons. Also Eng∣lysshmen though they had fro y
•
 begyn∣nynge thre maner of speches / southerne northerne / & myddle speche in y
•
 myddle of the londe / as they come of thre maner of people of Germania. Neuertheles by cōmixcyon & medlynge fyrst w
t
 Danes & afterward w
t

•
 coūtree language is appayred / for some vse straūge wlaffynge / chyteryng harryng / garryng & grysbytyng. This appayring of y
•
 language cometh of two thynges. One bycause y
•
 children y
•
 go to scole lerne to speke fyrst englysshe / & thā ben compelled to cōstrue theyr lessons in frensshe / & that hath bē vsed syth y
•
 Nor∣mans came in to Englonde. Also gentyl¦mens children ben lerned & taught from theyr youth to speke Frensshe / & vplon∣disshmen wyll coūterfeyte & lyken them selfe to gentylmen / and are besy to speke frensshe for to be more set by / wherfore it is sayd by a comyn {pro}uerbe. Iacke wold be a gentylmā yf he coude speke frensshe ¶ Treuisa. This was moche vsed to∣fore the grete deth / but syth it is somdele chaunged / for syr Iohn Cornewayle a mayster of grāmer chaūged y

 techynge of grāmer scole & cōstruccyon of frensshe in to englysshe. And other scole maysters vse y

•
 shall passe the see. And also gentylmen haue moche lefte to teche theyr chyldren to speke Frensshe. ¶ R. It semeth a grete wonder y
•
 Eng∣lysshmen haue so grete diuersite in theyr owne language in sowne & in speking of it / whiche is all in one ylonde. And y
•
 lan¦guage of Normandy is comen out of an other londe / & hath one maner sowne a∣monge all other y

 speke it in Englonde / for a man of kent / southerne / westerne & northerne men speke frensshe all lyke in sowne & speche / but they can not speke theyr englisshe so. ¶ Treuisa. Neuerthe¦lesse there ben as many diuers maner of frensshe in the realme of Fraūce / as dy∣uers englysshe in y

 realme of Englonde. ¶ R. Also of the foresayd tongue whiche is departed in thre is grete wonder / for men of y
•
 eest with men of y

 west accorde better in sownynge of theyr speche than men of y

 north w
t
 men of y

. All y
•
 lan∣guage of the northumbres & specially at Yorke is so sharpe shyteynge / fro
yng & vnshappe / y
•
 we southerne men may vn∣neth vnderstāde y

 language. I suppose the cause be y

 they be nigh to y

 alyens y
•
 speke straūgely. Also y
•
 kynges of Eng∣londe abyde & dwell more in y
•
 south coū∣tree thā in y

¶ De gentis huius moribus. Gir. in 
ere.


FOr y
•
 maners & doynge of walssh men & of Scottes ben tofore som∣what declared. Now I purpose to tell & declare y
•
 condicyons of y
•
 myddle people of Englonde. But the Flemynges y
•
 ben in y
•
 west syde of Wales ben now all tur¦ned as they were Englisshmen / bycause they company with Englysshmen. And


they be myghty & stronge to fyght / and ben the moost enemyes that Walshmen haue / and vse marcha
dyse & clothynge & ben full redy to put themselfe in auen∣tures & to peryll in y
•
 see & londe bycause of grete wynnyng / & ben redy somtyme to the plowe / & somtyme to dedes of ar∣mes whan tyme and place a
eth. It se∣meth of these men a grete wonder y
•
 in a bone of a wethers ryght sholder whan the flesshe is soden away and not rosted they knowe what hath be done / is done and shall be done / as it were by spiryte of propheeye & wonderfull crafte. They tell what is done in ferre countrees / to∣kens of peas or of warre / the state of the realme / sleynge of men & spousebreche / suche thynges they declare 
rtayne of tokens & sygnes that is in suche a shol∣der bone. ¶ R. But the Englysshmen y
•
 dwel in Englōde ben medled in y
•
 ylonde and ben ferre from the places that they spronge of fyrst turne to the contrary de∣des lyghtly without entycynge of ony other men by theyr owne assent. And vn easy also vnpacient of peas / enemyes of besynes / and full of slouth. ¶ Wilhel. de pon .li .iij. sayth. That whan they haue destroyed theyr enemyes all to y
•
 groūde than they fyght with themselfe and slee eche other / as a voyde and an empty sto mak werketh in it selfe. ¶ R. Neuerthe¦l
sse men of the south ben easyer & more mylde than men of y
•
 north. For they be more vnstable / more cruell / and more vn easy. The myddle men ben parteners w
t
 bothe. Also they vse them to glotony mo¦re than other men / & ben more costlewe in meet & clothynge. Men suppose that they toke y
t
 vyce of kynge Hardyknoght that was a Dane. For he badde set forth 
wyes double messe at dyner & at souper also. These men ben spedefull on hors & a fote / able & redy to all maner dedes of 
s / & ben wont to haue vyctory and maystry in euery fyght where no trea∣son is walkyng / and ben curyous & can well tell dedes & wōders that they haue seen. And they go in dyuers londes / vn∣neth ben ony men ryche in theyr owne londe or more gracyous in ferre and in straūge londe / they can better wynne & gete newe than kepe theyr owne hery∣tage. Therfore it is that they be spradde so wyde / & wene y
•
 euery londe is theyr owne. The men ben able to all maner of sleyght & wytte / but tofore y
•
 dede blon∣derynge & hasty / & more wyse after the dede than tofore / & leue of lyghtly what they haue begon. ¶ Solin{us} li .vj. Ther¦fore Eugenius the pope sayd / that Eng∣lysshmē were able to do what euer they wolde / & to be set & put tofore all other / ne were y
t
 lyght wytte letteth. And as Hanyball sayd that y
•
 Romayns myght not be ouercomē but in theyr own coūtre so Englysshmen may not be ouercomē in straūge londes / but in theyr owne coūtre they be lyghtly ouercomen. ¶ R. These men despyse theyr owne & prayse other men / & vnneth be pleased w
t
 theyr owne estate / what befalleth other men y
t
 they wyll gladly take to themselfe. Therfore it is y
t
 a yeman arayeth him as a squyer a squyer as a knyght / a knight as a du∣ke / a duke as a kyng. Yet some go about & wyll be lyke to all maner state & be ī no state / for they take euery degre y

•
 termes of latyn / as Argi / Tātali / Dedali / Sardinapali / ye


must vnderstande them as y
•
 poetes fey∣ned of them. Argus was an herde and kepte beestes / he had an hondred eyen / & Argus was also a shyppe / a shipman / & a chapman / & so Argus myght se before and behynde & on euery syde. Therfore he that is wyse & ware & can se that he be not deceyued / may be called Argus. And so the cronycle sayth in plurell nom¦bre y
•
 Englysshmen ben Argi / that is to saye / they se about where as wynnyng is. That other worde Tantali / the poete feyneth that Tantalus slewe his owne sone / wherfore he is dampned to perpe∣tuall penaūce / and he standeth alwaye in water vp to the nether lyppe / & hath alwaye rype apples & noble fruyte han¦gynge downe to the ouer lyppe. But the fruyte nor the water may not come w
t
in his mouth. He is so holden & stādeth by∣twene meet & drynke / and may neyther ete nor drynke / & is euer an hongred and a thyrst / that woo is hym alyue by this maner lykenes of Tantalus / they that do right nought there as is moche to do in euery syde ben called Tantali. It se∣meth that it is to say in trauayle they be Tantali / for they do ryght nought ther∣to. The thyrde worde is Dedali / take hede that Dedalus was a subtyll and a slye man. And therfore by lykenes they that ben subtyll and slye / they ben called Dedali. And the fourth worde is Sar∣danapali / ye shall vnderstāde y
t
 Sarda∣napalus was kynge of Assyryens / and was full vnchaste / & vsed hym for to lye softe. And by a maner of lykenes of hym they that lyue vnchastly bē called Sar∣danapali. ¶ R. But amōge all Englyssh¦men medled togyders is so grete a chaū¦gynge & diuersite of clothynge & of aray and so many maners & dyuers shappes that well nygh is there ony mā knowen by his clothynge and his araye of what someuer degree that he be. Therof pro∣phecyed an holy Anker in

ous / fyrst by Da∣nes / & than by Normans / & at y
•
 thyrde tyme by y
•
 Scottes that they holde the moost wretchest and leest worth of all other they shall be ouercomē. Than the worlde shall be so vnstable & so d

NOw this boke taketh in honde


Wales after Englonde


So take I my tales


And wende in to Wales


To that noble flode


Of Priamus blode


Knowlege for to wynne


Of grete Iupyters kynne


For to haue in mynde


Dardanus kynde


In these foure tytles I fonde


To tell the state of that londe


Cause of the men I shall

And than prayse the londe and well


Than I shall wryte with my pen


All the maners of the men


Than I shall fo

Of hors shepe oxen mylde


Good londe for all sedes


For corne gras and herbes that spredes


There ben wodes and medes


Herbes and floures there spredes


There ben ryuers and welles


Valeys and also hylles


Valeys brynge forth flood


And hylles metals good


Cooll groweth vnder londe


And gras aboue at honde


There lyme is copyous


And s

Hony and mylke whyte


There is deynte and not lyte


Of braket meete and ale


Is grete plente in that vale


And all that nedeth to the lyue


That londe bryngeth forth ryue


But of grete rychesse to be drawe


And close many in shorte sawe


It is a corner small


As though god fyrst of all


Made that londe so fele


To be seler of all hele


Wales is deled by

And many other doynge


They ben clothed wonders well


In a shyrte and in a mantell


A cryspe breche well fayne


Bothe in wynde and in rayne


In this clothynge they be bolde


Though the weder be ryght colde


Without shetes alwaye

Without surcot gowne cote and kyrtell


Without iopen tabarde cloke or bell


Without lace & chaplet y

Without hode hatte or cappes


Thus arayed gone the segges


And alwaye with bare legges



They kepe none other goynge


Though they mete with the kynge


With arowes and shorte speres


They fight with them that them deres


They fyght better yf they nede


Whan they go than whan they ryde


In stede of castell and toure


They take wodes & mareys for socour


Whan they seen it is to do


In fyghtynge they wolde be a go


Gyldas sayth they ben varyable


In peas and not stable


If men aske why it be


It is no wonder for to se


Though men put out of londe


To put out other wolde fonde


But all for nought at this stounde


For all many wodes ben at grounde


And put the see amonge


Ben castels buylded stronge


The men may dure longe vn ete


And loue well comune mete


They can ete and be mury


Without grete cury


They ete breed colde and hote


Of barly and of ote


Brode cakes rounde and thynne


As well semeth so grete kynne

And selde they done ones ete


They haue gruell to potage

And that maketh them drynke well


Meete and ale that hath myght

Euer the reder is the wyne


They holde it the more fyne


Whan they drynke at the ale


They tell many a lewde tale


For whan drynke is in handlynge


They ben full of ianglynge


At meet and after

Theyr solace is salte and leke


The husbonde in his wyse


Telleth that a grete pryse


To gyue a caudron with growese


To them that syt at his mele


He deleth his meet at mele


And gyueth euery man his dele


And all the ouer pluse

Therfore they haue woo

¶ Of the boūdyng of Irlonde. Ca. xxiij


IRlonde is the last of all y

 was Hermonius bro∣der / for these two bretherne gate & wan that londe by conquest. Or it is called Hi¦bernia of y

 ryuer Hiberus y

 is in y

 west ende of Spayne / & y

 londe hyght Scot∣lōde also / for Scottes dwelled there som tyme or they came in to y

 other Scotlōde that longed to Brytayne / therfore it is wryten in y

 Martyloge. Suche a daye in Scotlonde saynt Bryde was borne / & that was in Irlonde. This lōde hath in the southeest syde Spayne thre dayes saylynge thens a syde halfe / & hath in y

 eest syde y

 more Brytayn / thens a days saylynge / in the west syde y

 endles Oc∣cean / and in the north syde Yselonde thre dayes faylyng thens. ¶ Solinus. But the see that is bytwene Brytayne & Ir∣londe is all y

¶ Of the gretenes and qualite of that londe. Ca .xxiiij.


IRlonde is an ylonde gretest after Brytayn / & stretcheth north

 see in y

 syde in brede iiij. iourneys / & Irlonde is narower in y
•
 myddle than in the endes / all otherwyse than Brytayn is / as Irlonde is shorter north ward than Britayn / so is it longer south ward / the londe is not playne / but full of moūtaynes / of hylles / of wodes / of marays / & of mores / the londe is softe rayny / wyndy / & lowe by y
•
 see syde / & w
t
∣in hylly & sondy. ¶ Solmus. There is grete plente of noble pasture and of leese therfore y
•
 beestes must be ofte dryuē out of theyr pasture lest they 
te ouer moche for they sholde shende themselfe yf they myght ete at theyr wyll. ¶ Gir. Men of that londe haue comynly theyr helth / & straūgers haue oft a perylous 
 / by cause of y
•
 moisture of y
•
 meet. The flesshe of kyen is there holsom / & swynes flesshe vnholsom. Men of y
•
 londe haue no feuer but onely y
•
 feuer ague / and that ryght selde. Therfore the holsomnes of y
•
 londe & the clennes out of venym is worth all the boost & richesse of trees / of herbes / of spycery / of ryche clothes / & of precyous stones of the eest londes. The cause of y
•
 helth & holsomnes of y
•
 londe is y
•
 attem∣perate hete & colde that is therin. In
∣bus reb{us} sufficit. In this londe ben m
o kyen than oxen / more pasture than corne more grasse than seed / there is plente of samon / of lamprays / of 
eles / & of other see fysshe. Of egles / of cranes / of pecoks of curlewes / of sparowhawkes of ges∣hawkes / & of gentyll fawcons. Of wel∣ues & ryght shrewed myte / there ben at∣tercoppes / blode soukers / eeftes y
•
 do n
 harme / there ben fayres lytell of body & ful hardy & stronge / there ben batnacles foules lyke wylde gees / whiche grewe wondersly vpon trees / as it were nature wrought agaynst kynde. Men of rely∣gyon ete barnacles vpon fastyng dares bycause they be not engendred w
t
 flesshe wherin as me thȳketh they erre / for 
a¦son is agaynst y

 flesshe cometh wondersly of y

 Irlōde hath no bees. Neuerthe¦lesse it were better wryten y

 Irlōde had bees & no vyneyerdes. ¶ Be

 there is grete hūtyng to roobuckes / & it is knowen y

 there be none. It is no won¦der of Beda / for he neuer sawe y

 londe / 


but some man tolde hȳ suche tales. Also there groweth that stone Saxagon{us} / & is called Iris also / as it were the rayne bowe / yf that stone be holden agaynst y

 sonne / anone it shall shape a raynbowe. There is also founden a stone y

 is called Gagathes / & whyte margery perles.






¶ Of the defaute of the londe. Ca .xxv.


Hete cornes ben there full small vnneth clensed w
t
 mānes hande reserued mē / all beestes bē smaller there than in other lōdes. There lacketh well nygh al maner fresshe water fysshe y
•
 is not gendred in the see. There lacketh vn¦kynde faucons / gerfaucons / pertryche / fesaūt / nyghtyngales and pyes. There lacketh also Roo & Bucke / & Ilespyles / wontes / and other venymous beestes. Therfore some men feyne & that fauou∣rably y
•
 saynt Patryck clensed y
•
 londe of wormes & of venymous beestes. But it is more probable & skylfull y
•
 this londe was from y
•
 begynnynge alwaye w
t
out suche wormes / for venymous beestes & wormes dye there anone yf men brynge them thyder out of other lōdes. Also ve∣nym and poyson brought thyder out of other londes / lese theyr malyce as soone as it passeth the myddle of the see. Also poudre & erth of that londe cast & sowen in other londes dryue away wormes / so ferforth that yf a turfe of y
•
 londe be put about a worme it sleeth hym or maketh hym thryll that erth for to escape away. In that londe cockes crowe but lytell to∣fore daye / so that the fyrst crowynge of cockes in that londe & the thirde in other londes ben lyke ferre tofore the daye.






¶ Of them that fyrst enhabyted Irlonde. Ca .xxvj.


GIrald{us} sayth that Casera Noes nece drad the flode & fledde w
t
 thre men & fyfty women in to that ylonde / & dwelled therin fyrst the last yere tofore Noes flode. But afterwarde Barthola∣nus Seres sone that came of Iaphet Noes sone came thider w

 his thre sones by happe or by crafte .CCC. yere after Noes flode / & dwelled there & encreaced to y

 they had slayne / they dyed all saue one Rua∣nus that lyued. M .v .C. yere vnto saynt Patrykes tyme / & enformed y

 holy man of the foresayd men / & of all the doynges and dedes. Than the thyrde tyme came thyder Nimeth out of Scicia w

 last of his ofsprynge by dyuers my shappes of warre & of moreyne they were clene destroyed and the londe lefte voyde .CC. yere after. The fourth tyme v. dukes that were bretherne Gandius Genandus / Sagādius / Rutheragus & Slauius / of the sayd Nimethes succes∣sours came out of Grece & occupied that lōde & deled it in .v. partyes / & euery par¦tye cōteyneth .xxij. candredes. A cādrede is a coūtree y

 conteyneth an .C. townes / & they set a stone in the myddle of y

 lond as it were in the nauell and begynnyng of .v. kyngdomes. At the last Slauius was made kyng of all y

 lond. The fyfth tyme whan this nacyon was .xxx. yere togyder they wexed feble. Foure noble men that were Millesius y

 kȳges sones came out of Spayne w

 many other in a nauy of .xl. shyppes / & .ij. of y

 worthyest of these .iiij. bretherne y

 hyght Hyber{us} & Hermon deled y

 lōde bytwene them two But afterward couenaūt was brokē by¦twene them bothe & Hyber{us} was slayne Than Hermon was kyng of all y

 fyrst Patrykes tyme were kynges of y

 nacyon .C .xxxi. And so fro y

 comynge of Hibernensis vn¦to y

 fyrst Patryk were. M. viij .C. yere.


They had that name Hibernensis & Hi∣bernia of y

 foresayd Hiberus / or els of Hi¦bet{us} a ryuer of Spayne. They were cal¦led also Gatels & Scottes of one Gayte∣lus y

 was Phenis neuewe. This Gay∣telus coude speke many lāguages after the lāguages that were made at Nem∣proths Toure / and wedded one Scotta Pharoes doughter. Of these dukes ca∣me y
•
 Hibernēsis. Men saye y
•
 this Gay∣telus made y
•
 Irysshe language / & called it Gaytelaf / as it were a language ga∣dred of all languages & tongues. At the last Belinus kyng of Britayn had a sone and hyght Gurgūcius that came out of Denmarke / at the ylondes Orcades he foūde men that were called Basclensis / and were comen thyder out of Spayne / these men prayed & besought to haue a place to dwell in. And y
•
 kyng sent them to Irlonde that was tho voyde & waste & ordeyned & sent w
t
 them dukes & capy∣tayns of his own. And so it semeth y

 It londe 
shold
 longe to Brytayne by ryght of olde tyme. From y
•
 fyrst saynt Patryk vnto Fedliundius y
•
 kynges tyme .cccc. yere regned .xxxiij. kynges eueryche af∣ter other in Irlonde. In this Fedliundi{us} tyme Turgesius duke and capytayne of Norway brought thyder men of Nor∣way & occupyed y

 lond / & made in many places depe dyches and castels / sengle / double & treble / & many wardes strong∣ly walled / & many of them stande yet all hole / but the Irysshmen retche not of ca¦stels / for they take woodes for castels / & marays & mores for castell dyches. But at y
•
 last Turgesius dyed by gylefulnes of women. And Englysshmen saye that Gurmūdus wan Irlonde & made those dyches / & made no mencyon of Turge∣sius. And Irysshmen speke of Turge
{us} & knowe not of Gurmūdus. Therfore it is to wyte that Gurmūdus had wonne Brytayn & dwelled therin / & sent Turge¦sius with grete strengthe in to Irlonde for to wynne y

 londe / & bycause Turge∣sius was capytayne & leder of y

 v
age & iourney and seen amonge them / therfore Irysshmen speke moche of hȳ as a noble man y

 was seen in y

Not lōge after thre bre¦therne / Amelanus / S

Also they vse no sadels / boo∣tes ne spurres whan they ryde / but they dryue theyr horses w

¶ Of the meruayles and wonders of Irlonde. Ca .xxviij.


MAny men tell that in y
•
 north syde of Irlonde is y
•
 londe of lyfe. In that ylonde no man may dye / but whan they be olde & vexed with grete sekenes they be borne out in to the nexte londe / & there dye. ¶ There is another ylonde in Irlonde y
•
 no woman therin may 
e
e a chylde / but yet she may cōceyue. ¶ Also there is an ylonde in whiche no deed bo∣dy may rotte. In Vltonia y
•
 is Ʋlster is an yl
de that a 
uke wonderly departeth in twayne. In y
•
 one parte is grete distur baunce 
 discomforte of fr
des / & in that other party grete lykynge & comforte of holy aungels. There is also sayne Pa∣trykes purgatory / that was shewed at his prayer to conferme his prechynge & his 
ore whan he preched to mysbyleued men of sorowe & payne y
•
 euyll men shold suffre for theyr euyll werkes / & of ioye & of blysse that good men shall receyue for theyr holy dedes. He telleth that who y
•
 suffreth y
•
 paynes of purgatory (yf it be enioyned hym for penaūce) he shal neuer suffre the paynes of hell / but he dye fy∣nally w
t
out tepentaūce of synne / as y
e
 en∣sample is set more ful at the ende of this chap
te. ¶ Treuisa. But truly no man may be saued but yf he be very repētaūt what someuer penaunce he do / & euery man that is very repentaūt at his lyues ende shal be sekerly saued / though he ne∣uer here of saynt Patrykes purgatory. There is an ylonde in Connacte Sa
 / y
•
 is in y
•
 see of Conaccina halowed by saȳ
 Brandon / y
•
 hath no myce / there deed bo¦dyes ben not buryed / but bē kepte out of the erth & rotte not. In Mamoma is a welle / who y
•
 wassheth hym w
t
 the wa∣terof y
•
 welle / he shall were hoore on his heed. There is an other well in Vltonia who someuer is wasshen therin he shall neuer wexe hoore afterwarde. There is a welle in Moūstre or Mamoma / yf 
ny man touche y
•
 well / anone shall fall grete rayne in all that prouynce / & that rayne shall neuer cesse tyll a preest y
•
 is a 
ne mayden synge a masse in a chapell that is fast by & blysse y
•
 water / & with mylke of a 
 that is of one yere besprynge y
•
 welle / and so reconcyle the welle in this straunge maner. At Glyndal
an aboute the oratory of saynt Keywyn wytches bere apples as it were apple trees / and ben more holsome than sauery. That ho¦ly sayne brought forth these apples by prayers for to 
 his childe y
•
 was seke


There is a lake in Ʋlster & moche fysshe therin whiche is .xxx. myle in length / & xv. in brede. The ryuer Ban renneth out of that lake in to y
•
 north Occean / & men saye that this lake began in this maner. There were men in y
t
 countree y
t
 were of euyll lyuynge (coeuntes cū Brutis) And there was a welle in y
•
 londe in grete re∣uerence of olde tyme / & alwaye couered / yf it were lefte vncouered / the well wold ryse & drowne all y
•
 londe. And so it hap∣ped that a woman went to y
t
 welle for to fetche water: & hyed her fast to her childe that wepte in the cradell / & lefte y
•
 welle vncouered / than y
e
 welle sprange so fast that it drowned y
e
 woman & her chylde / and made all the coūtree a lake & a fysshe ponde. For to preue y
e
 this is sothe it is a grete argument / that whan y
e
 weder is clere / fysshers of y
t
 water se in y
•
 grounde vnder the water rounde toures & hygh shapen as steples & chirches of y
•
 londe. In the north syde of Irlonde in the coū∣tree of Ossyryens euery .vij. yere at the prayer of an holy abbot / twayne that bē wedded a man & a woman must nedes be exyled and forshapen in to lykenes of wolues / & abyde out .vij. yere. And at y
•
 ende of .vij. yere yf they lyue they come home agayne & take agayn theyr owne shape / and than shall other twayne go forth in theyr stede / and so forshapen for other .vij. yere. There is a lake in this londe / yf a poole of tree pyght & stycked therin / that parte of the shafte or poole y
t
 is in the erth shall turne in to yren / and that parte y
•
 abydeth in the water shall turne in to stone / and that parte that a∣bydeth aboue shall be tree in his owne kynde. Also there is a lake that turneth h
sell in to asshe / and asshe in to hasel / yf it be done therin. Also in Irlonde bē thre 
 lepes / there as samons lepe a∣
st a roche a longe speres lengthe. 
 Leg
 is a pond there ben seen Colmans byrdes / the byrdes called Certelles / and come homely to 
 hande / but yf men do them wroug
 or harme / they go away & come not agayn and the water there shall be bytter and stynke / & he that dyd y
•
 wronge shall not astert without wreche & myschefe / but yf he do amendes. ¶ 
. As touchynge saynt Patrykes purgatory / ye shall vn∣derstande that y
•
 seconde saynt Patryke that was abbot & not bysshop whyle he preched in Irlonde / laboured & studyen for to turne thylke wycked men y
•
 lyued as beestes out of theyr euyl lyfe for drede of y
•
 paynes of h
ll / & for to cōferme them to good lyf. And they sayd they wold not turne but some of them myght knowe som what of the grete paynes & also of y
•
 blysse that he spake of. Than saynt Pa∣tryke prayed to almyghty god therfore / & our lord Iesu Chryst appered to saynt Patryke / & toke hym a staffe & ladde hȳ in to a wylde place & shewed hym there a rounde pyt y
•
 was derke within & sayd / that yf a man were very repentaūt & sta¦ble in byleue & went in to this pyt & wal¦ked therin a daye & a nyght / he sholde se the sorowes & the paynes of euyl men / & the Ioye and blysse of good men. Than Chryst vanisshed out of Patrikes syght And saynt Patryke arered and buylded there a chirche / and put therin chanons reguler / & closed the pyt aboute with a wall / & is now in the chirche yerde at the eest ende of the chirche / & fast shette with a stronge dore / for no man sholde nycely go in without leue of the bysshop / or of the pryour of y
•
 place. Many men went in and came out agayne in saynt Patry¦kes tyme / & tolde of paynes & Ioye that they had seen / and the meruayles that they sawe ben there yet wryten / and by∣cause therof many men turned & were conuerted to ryght byleue. Also many men went in & came neuer out agayne.


In kyng Stephens tyme kyng of Eng¦londe / a knyght y
•
 hyght Owayne went in to saynt Patrykes purgatory & came agayn / & dwelled euer after duryng his lyfe in the nedes of the abbey of Luden∣sis that is of y
•
 ordre of Cysteaux / & tolde many wonders that he had seen in Pa∣trykes purgatory. That place is called Patrykes purgatory / and the chirche is named Reglis. No man is enioyned for to go in to that purgatory / but coūseyled that he sholde not come therin / but take vpon hym other penaūce. And yf a man haue auoided & be saable and wyl nedes go therin / he shall fyrst go to the bysshop and than he shall be sent with lettres to the pryoue of y
•
 place / & they bothe shall coūseyle hym to leue. And yf he wyll ne∣des go therto / he shall be in prayers & in fastynge .xv. dayes / and after .xv. dayes he shall be houseled & ladde to the dore of the purgatory with processyon & letany and yet he shall be coūseyled to leue it / & yf he be stedfast and wyll en
e / the dore shall be opened & he blyssed & go in god∣des name / & holde forth his waye / and the dore shall be fast shette tyll the nexte daye / and whan the tyme is the pryour shall come and open the dore / and yf the man be comen he ledeth hym in to y
•
 chir¦che with {pro}cessyon / and there he shall be xv. dayes in prayers and fastynge.






¶ Of the meruayles of sayntes of Irlonde. Ca .xxix.


HEre Girald{us} maketh mynde that as men of this nacyon ben more angry than other men / & more hasty for to take wreche whyles they ben alyue / so sayntes & halowes of this londe ben more wrechefull than sayntes of other londes. Clerkes of this londe ben chaste and saye many prayers / & done grete ab¦stynence a daye / & drynke al nyght / so is accoūted for a myracle y
•
 
ery 
th not there as wyne regneth / and ben cha¦sen out of abbeys in to the clergy / & done as monkes sholde. But they y
•
 ben 
yll of them ben worste of all other. So good men amonge them though they ben but fewe ben good at y
e
 best. Prelates of that countree ben full 
owe in cor
 o
 trespace / and besy in cōtemplacyon / and not in prechyng of goddes worde. Ther¦fore it is that all y
•
 sayntes of that londe ben cōfessours and no martyrs amonge them / & no wonder / for al the prelates of this londe clerkes and prelates sholde do is to them vnknowen. Therfore whā 
 was put agaynst the bysshop of Cassyll how it myght be that so many sayntes ben in Irlonde & neuer a martyr amōge them all / sythen y
•
 the men bē so shrewed and so angry / & the prelates so recheles and slowe in cor
eccyon of trespace. The bysshop answered frowardly ynough & sayd. Our men ben shrewed and angry ynough to themselfe / but to goddes ser∣uaūtes they ley neuer hāde / but do them grete reuerence & worshyp / but englyssh men come in to this londe that can make martyrs / & were wont to vse that crafte ¶ 
. The bisshop sayd so bycause y
•
 kyng Henry the seconde was tho newe comen in to Irlonde fresshely after the marty
 dome of saynt Thomas of Caūterbury. ¶ Gir. In this londe / in wales & in 
 londe ben belles and staues with croked hedes / & other suche thȳges for retykes in grete reuerence & worship / so y
•
 men of this londe drede more for to swere vpon one of those belles & golden staues than vpon the gospels. The chefe of all suche relykes is holden Iesus staffe that is a
 Deuelyn / with y
•
 whiche staffe they say that y
•
 fyrst saynt Patryke droue y
•
 wor∣mes out of Irlond. ¶ Aug{us}. de ci. dei ca .vij. yf men a
e how it may be y
•
 dyuers maner of beestes & of dyuers kynde that



 kyndly goten bytwene male & female come 
 ben in ylondes after Noes flode. Men suppose that suche beestes 
wāme in to ylondes about
 / & fyrst to the nexte and 
o forth in to other. Or els men say∣lynge in to ylondes brought with them suche beestes for loue of huntynge. Or aungels at god almyghtyes camaunde mēt brought suche beestes in to ylondes aboute / or the erth brought them forth fyrst / and fulfylled tho goddes cōmaun∣dement / that cōmaūded y
•
 erth to brynge forth grasse and quycke beestes.
